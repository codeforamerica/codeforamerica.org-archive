            <h4>About</h4>

            <p>March 16-22 is Sunshine Week! In honor of the occasion, we'll be taking a deep dive into the public records request process to examine the ins and outs of effectively tracking, routing, and responding to citizen requests for public information. John Kaehny will be talking about the work of Reinvent Albany and Karen Boyd will share a case study of how the City of Oakland has evolved their approach to open public records; why open data can save your organization time and money when responding to records request; and how technology can be used to help streamline the process for citizens and city employees alike.</p>
