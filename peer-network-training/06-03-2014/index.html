            <h4>About</h4>

            <p>Last year CfA fellows partnered with the Human Services Agency of San Francisco to build a more efficient, client-centered system. Bringing the end user mindset to the HSA process, the fellows had three challenges: to help SF residents find services, make sure HSA clients receive all of the services for which they’re qualified, reduce churn – the number of clients unnecessarily dropping off and then returning to services. In this webinar we discuss how the HCD methodology guided HSA to improve communications with the public, and how Promptly helps thousands of residents maintain their food stamps benefits with a helpful text message.</p>
