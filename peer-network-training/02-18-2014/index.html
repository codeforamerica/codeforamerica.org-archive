            <h4>About</h4>

            <p>In just a few years, Mike Flowers took NYC MODA from a one-man shop to become one of the most renowned civic data teams in the country. Through data analytics, in-house technical talent, and close partnerships with domain experts, MODA has pioneered new approaches to civic analytics that have generated tangible improvements to city service delivery and citizen quality of life in NYC.</p>

<p>In this online session, NYC's former Chief Analytics Officer Michael Flowers and former lead data scientist Lauren Talbot will share the ins and outs of building a successfuly government data dream team: how they worked with legacy infrastructure, how they built momentum in the early days, how they hired and structured a team, and how to get started gleaning new insights from the data your city already holds.</p>
