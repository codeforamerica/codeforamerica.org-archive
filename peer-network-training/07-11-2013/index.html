            <h4>About</h4>

            <p>Increasing civic engagement is an oft-voiced goal of civic technology initatives — and yet, it's notoriously difficult to measure. How do you know if your initiative is succeeding in increasing meaningful engagement? What are the right metrics to be tracking?</p>
            
<p>MindMixer and Measured Voice are two civic startups that have tackled that very issue head on. Join Nick Bowden, CEO of MindMixer, and Jed Sundwall, CEO of Measured Voice, for an introduction to the approaches to measuring civic engagement they've tried at their companies and what the challenges are for measuring engagement. We'll then open it up to a discussion about what's worked, what hasn't, and what kind of benchmarks we should align on to enable better outcomes.</p>
