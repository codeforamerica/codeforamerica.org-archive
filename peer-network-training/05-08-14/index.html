            <h4>About</h4>

            <p><a href="https://zip.kiva.org/">Kiva Zip</a> is a pilot program, launched by Kiva, that enables you to make direct loans to entrepreneurs in Kenya and the United States. You can make a loan today for as little as $5. Over time, as your loan is repaid, you get your money back, and you can then withdraw it, or relend it to another entrepreneur.</p>
