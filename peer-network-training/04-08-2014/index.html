            <h4>About</h4>

            <p>The <a href="http://maps.co.mecklenburg.nc.us/qoldashboard/">Charlotte Quality of Life Dashboard</a> is a collection of social, crime, physical, economic and environmental indicators designed to help assess the health of neighborhoods in Charlotte and Mecklenburg County. In this webinar, project leaders Tom Warshauer and Rebecca Hefner will share the story behind the quality of life study, the decision and process to make the data more accessible via a dashboard, and explore some examples of interesting ways the community has used the information to build better neighborhoods.</p>

            <h4>Customize</h4>

            <p>The original tool was a beast to customize. The second verion is much simpler and easier to manipulate for your own local or interest. The developer behind the tool, Tobin Bradley, recently made a <a href="http://fuzzytolerance.info/blog/2014/06/02/customizing-the-quality-of-life-dashboard/">screen share</a> for how to customize version two, please do have a look.</p>
