            <h4>About</h4>

            <p>OpenTrails (The Open Trail System Specification) is an open data format developed in partnership between Code for America and a broad coalition of park agencies, outdoor software industry members, and non-profit leaders like the National Recreation and Parks Association. OpenTrails allows agencies to publish their data in a common format for use in shared websites and apps, and makes the data open and available for use by third party developers, and large consumers of data.

Weâ€™ll talk about how Code for America and the National Recreation and Parks Association led the stakeholder process that supports OpenTrails, how data is currently being used, and upcoming opportunities to prepare and publish OpenTrails data in your own government. </p>

<p class="isolate text-whisper">This event is hosted by the <a href="http://peernetwork.in">Code for America Peer Network</a>, CfA's community of innovators working in local government from over thirty cities and counties.
