            <h4>About</h4>

            <p>Staying relevant to popular methods of communication is key to successful community engagement. In this webinar we cover the implications of widening your reach by using a method 90% of people use - text messaging. We discuss how <a title="Textizen" href="https://www.textizen.com/">Textizen</a>, an SMS feedback platform, was used in Buffalo's <a title="One Region Forward" href="http://www.oneregionforward.org/">One Region Forward</a> planning efforts supported by HUD and the University at Buffalo. We cover how the technology was implemented, goals for the platform, extent and strategy of the campaign and the current results.</p>
