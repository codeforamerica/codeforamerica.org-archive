<p><strong>Civic Collaboration and Social Coding: What Open Source and GitHub mean for Open Government.</strong><br />
Open government leaders like Clay Shirky have often extolled the potential of open source and tools like GitHub to transform the way government works. And now that even the White House is posting code on the popular social coding site, it seems like is more than just a passing trend. But what does it mean on a practical level for how local government leaders do their jobs? How can local government officials leverage these new tools to be make government more efficient, effective, and collaborative?<br />
Join this conversation with Ben Balter, former Presidential Innovation Fellow and now Head Government Evangelist at GitHub, for an introductory overview of the benefits of social coding, open source, and GitHub; stories of emergent use cases for local government; and basic steps of how can local govs get started using GitHub.</p>
