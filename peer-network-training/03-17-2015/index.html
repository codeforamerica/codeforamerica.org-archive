            <h4>About</h4>

            <p>As the open data movement grows and evolves, governments are thinking more strategically about how to release data sets. Because many issues, from transportation to water quality, are often addressed across jurisdictions, a regional approach to open data programs is beginning to emerge.
 
This webinar will cover regional open data programs in Pittsburgh and Sacramento. We will learn about a partnership between the City of Pittsburgh, the University of Pittsburgh and the Carnegie Mellon Foundation, and the benefits of a community-driven approach to open data programs. In Sacramento, we will hear about the Sacramento Area Council of Governments’ efforts to gather the region's Chief Innovation Officers and IT Managers to collaborate on a plan for rolling out open data across 28 jurisdictions.</p>
