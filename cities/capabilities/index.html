            <p>Through four years of experimenting and learning through the Code for America Fellowship in 32 local governments, we’ve seen that there’s a set of key capabilities that help cities fully take advantage of the Fellowship engagement.</p>

            <p>When these capabilities are in place, we've observed  that cities are better equipped to embrace a culture of innovative problem-solving, apply modern tools and approaches to address community needs, and leverage technology and data to foster collaboration with residents.</p>

            <p>While no single city needs to employ all of these approaches, in our experience, those that possess some combination of these capabilities and deliberately invest in building others over the course of the year get the most out of their Fellowship engagement.</p>

           	<p>Governments that use “human-centered design practices” make it a priority in any project to conduct research with residents to inform a better picture of who they are, what they need, and how they behave. By starting with an understanding of who they are serving, government is better able to provide convenient and effective access to public services and information that’s tailored to resident’s needs, comprehension, and literacy.</p>
           	
           	<h4>How other cities have done it</h4>
           	
		           	<ul>
		           		<li><strong></strong>Chicago: the Chicago Civic User Testing Group.</strong> In Chicago, the Civic User Testing group ensures that new civic apps undergo rigorous user testing with actual citizens from a diverse set of racial, socioeconomic, and geographic backgrounds.</li>
									<li><strong>Oakland: Civic Design Workshop.</strong> City staff in Oakland conducted a series of cross-departmental design workshops to map out all the components of the special event permitting process and create a new, streamlined system.</li>
