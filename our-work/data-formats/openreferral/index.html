                <p>Information about health, human, and social services is an essential element of our public infrastructure. It is literally what one needs to ‘see’ the safety net. It should be reliable and easy to find, in all kinds of ways.</p>

                <p>But there’s no one way to keep track of all these services, so lots of different organizations produce their own directories with much of the same information, formatted differently — yielding a wasteful and fragmented landscape of silos.</p>

                <p>We’ve written about why this is such a hard problem, both <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/2014/04/17/help-finding-help/">on Code for America's blog</a> and in the book <a href="http://beyondtransparency.org/chapters/part-5/towards-a-community-data-commons/"><i>Beyond Transparency</i></a>. Over the past few months, the Open Referral initiative has been gearing up to tackle this problem. Through a multi-stakeholder, multi-city collaboration, we’re going to make it easier to compile, share, and find this information.</p>
