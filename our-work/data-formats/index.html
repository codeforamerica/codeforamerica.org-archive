            <h34 class="h4">Local government needs to do more with less. So let's do more with what we have never had more of: data. Code for America's recommended formats make open data easier to access, use, and move to the applications people already use to make decisions.</h4>

         <h3 class="h3">What can open data formats do for you?</h3>
         <p>
         <b>Local Government</b>
         </p>
         <p>Open data formats make the public data governments already collect more valuable. Standardized data can travel to citizens where and when they need it most. Adopting standards also gives governments access to the world of open-source civic apps–often available a little to no cost–that enable their public agencies to improve service delivery and do more with less.</p>

         <p>
         <b>Technologists</b>
         </p>
         <p>When cities across the country format their data in the same way, technologists can build tools that scale across cities at a fraction of the effort and cost. Open data formats streamline the process of finding and using data across city agencies. That means that civic apps can come from technologists with talent and drive, not just big companies with cash on hand.</p>

         <p>
          <b>Citizens</b>
         </p>
         <p>Data standards help citizens get the information they need to make the best decisions possible for their families, businesses, and communities. Every day countless citizens make hard decisions about where to live, how to commute, and where to spend their money. With standardized public data, citizens anywhere can receive unprecedented guidance on the decisions they face, helping our cities become fair, efficient, and sustainable.</p>
