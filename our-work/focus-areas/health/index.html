<!-- When including <br> tags after the section headers, the layout-minim modules don't have enough space between columns. See the inline-style changes to width and padding around Rebecca's  and Jake's videos. -->

		<!-- This section in particular needed breaks following the header to give space between header and content -->
		<!-- inline style reducing top margin to keep text and video top-aligned -->
		<p>The health focus area works to improve the health of people and their communities. Health outcomes depend on many factors: ranging from the environment people live in, to how easy it is to sign up for, use, and deliver digital services.</p>
		<p>Code for America works with the wide variety of teams that contribute to these outcomes&mdash;including city health departments, public health agencies, state offices, and non-profit organizations. Together, we develop digital services that measurably improve community health, and help these teams retool their ways of delivering services to be more effective in the digital world.</p>

		<h2>Get Involved</h2>
		<br>
		<p>Pursuing better health in a community often requires partnerships that span the public, non-profit, and private sectors. In San Francisco for example, our work to improve food security is built on foundational partnerships with the San Francisco Human Services Agency, the Food Bank of San Francisco and Marin, and a coalition of community partners. This public interest work is often supported by generous support from corporate and institutional funders.</p>

		<p>To expand our work and deepen our impact, we are seeking partners in cities and states across the country, along with key institutional support. If you are committed to improve health in your community through the transformation of public services, <a href="mailto:rebeccac@codeforamerica.org">contact us.</a></p>

		<h2>How we work</h2>
		<br>
		<p>Code for America’s focus areas bring together work across all of our programs, delivering an impact greater than what each program might achieve on its own. Across our programs, we undertake deep research into the delivery of critical services, develop new digital approaches to health, incubate digital products as they mature, and work with the highest levels of government support to scale digital services. Throughout these efforts, we work to empower our partner organizations through the <a href="/governments/principles">Principles of 21st Century Government.</a></p>

		<h4 class="heading">Original digital services produced with governments</h4>
		<p><a href="/governments/fellowship/">The Code for America Fellowship Program</a> sends teams of technologists into local governments across the country to work full-time for a year in partnership with government officials and the community. The fellows apply 21st Century Government Principles to important problems, focused on health, economic development, and safety and justice. While the product of the Fellowship is typically an early stage application that improves the delivery of a government service, the process acts as a vehicle for driving cultural and structural change inside of government.</p>
