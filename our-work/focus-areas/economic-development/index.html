<!-- OUR APPROACH -->
<section class="layout-semibreve intro">


	<h2>Our Approach</h2>

	<div class="layout-minim">
		<p>The economic development focus area works to improve economic opportunity for all people and their communities. Economic outcomes depend on a place-based context of communities, and range across concentrated growth, revitalization or advancement of core governmental services and benefits necessary for business and job growth.</p>

		<p>Code for America works across a wide variety of teams who contribute to these outcomes—including municipal economic development departments, public-private economic development corporations, redevelopment authorities, and non-profit organizations. Together, we develop digital services that measurably improve economic opportunity, and help these teams retool their ways of delivering services to be more effective in the digital world.</p>

<!-- HOW WE WORK -->
<section>
	<div class="layout-semibreve">
		<h2>How we work</h2>
		<p>Code for America’s focus areas bring together work across all of our programs, delivering an impact greater than what each program might achieve on its own. Across our programs, we undertake deep research into the delivery of critical services, develop new digital approaches to economic opportunity, incubate digital products as they mature, and work with the highest levels of government support to scale digital services. Throughout these efforts, we work to empower our partner organizations through the <a href="/governments/principles">Principles of 21st Century Government.</a></p>

		<div class="layout-crotchet">
		    <p><strong>Original Research and Digital Work</strong></p>
        <p>Fellowship teams work with cities and counties to develop innovative digital approaches to delivering key government services.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="layout-crotchet">
		    <p><strong>Building and scaling Digital Services</strong></p>
         <p>As fellowship teams move on, we work to transform promising new technologies into the mature digital services citizens deserve in the 21st century.</p>

		<div class="layout-crotchet">
		    <p><strong>Helping Governments Deliver Digital Services</strong></p>
        <p>We document what we learn to make building digital government easy to understand and copy through our <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/library/">library</a> and <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/about/peernetwork/">Peer Network</a>.

	<h4 class="heading">Partnering with governments to produce original digital services</h4>
	<p><a href="/governments/fellowship/">The Code for America Fellowship Program</a> sends teams of technologists into local governments across the country to work full-time for a year in partnership with government officials and the community. The fellows apply 21st Century Government Principles to important problems, focused on health, economic development, and safety and justice. While the product of the Fellowship is typically an early stage application that improves the delivery of a government service, the process acts as a vehicle for driving cultural and structural change inside of government.</p>

	    <blockquote>
	    	<p>We will soon begin recruiting city and county government partners for 2017 Fellowships! <a href="/governments/fellowship/">Learn more about applying.</a></p>

	<h4 class="heading">Impacting Small Business and Workforce Development</h4>
	<p>The economic development focus area targets interventions that impact small businesses and low income populations to:</p>
	<ul>

		<li>Reduce barriers to low-income families and entrepreneurs in taking advantage of government programs and services </li>
		<li>Broaden access to skills-building and upward mobility of the workforce</li>
	</ul>

	<h4 class="heading">Ongoing Work</h4>
	<p>We have worked with more than 50 communities to support growth and healthy economic development practice within three strategic areas:</p>
