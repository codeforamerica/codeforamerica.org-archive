		<h3>A Critical Interaction Point</h3>
				
		<p>A city's main website is the online equivalent of city hall. Residents expect to be able to go there to do all of their government business in one place— but for local government staff, providing this is easier said than done. Code for America is working with several US cities to rethink the city website in order to improve the experience for both residents and city employees.</p>

		<h3>Serving Vulnerable Residents</h3>
		
		<p>Improving access to necessary health and human services is critical to ensuring the safety of our populations. Code for America is working on software to make it easier for people to sign up for food stamps, data standards for restaurant and home safety inspections, and policy changes to allow governments to communicate more effectively with clients via SMS.</p>

		<h3>The Foundation for Change</h3>
		
		<p>Government purchasing rules have fallen out of step with the pace at which technology now improves, and almost make it inevitable that local governments will be poorly served by their vendors. We are working to shift this dynamic by piloting new models that give governments more control over the purchasing process, more flexibility in terms of options, and bring new vendors into the ecosystem, while still providing important protections against fraud and abuse.</p>

		<h3>Making City Hall Open by Default</h3>
		
		<p>When public data is made freely available in open, standardized formats, it can drive transparency, community engagement, and accountability. Governments around the country are building a culture and commitment to openness in City Hall across departments by making government data openly and easily available to citizens — and supporting open data with process and technology. We're working to help cities and counties get open data initiatives off the ground and take open data beyond transparency, drawing upon the experience and expertise of other governments who have successfully done so.</p>
