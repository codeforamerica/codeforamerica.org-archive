This document is a summary of how IT leaders in Code for America's peer network are using capital funds for cloud or virtual infrastructure. 

## Systems, not servers

 - Define systems being built to perform a specific business function as capital assets. These systems might have a lifetime of 7 to 20 years, instead of the usual 3 year depreciation cycle of a physical server. 
 
 - Work with the internal and/or external auditors that review your comprehensive annual financial report (CAFR) to get their agreement that what you are planning is a system implementation.

## Check what's allowable

 - *THIS NEEDS FACT CHECKING* Many components of an IT system are allowable under standard GAAP capitalization rules, such as hardware, software, professional services and employee labor costs and training curriculum development. 

 - *THIS NEEDS FACT CHECKING* It should be possible to aggregate the costs of migration to a new cloud platform into a single capital project. This means it should be possible to include related business process development and documentation changes.

 - Get agreement from your financial controller that system components as well as migration costs can be treated as a capital project and that they can be pooled into a single project. This will also help to pass a minimum threshold that might be required for capital project treatment. 

## Break a project into phases

 - If your single, pooled project cannot be funded in a single budget cycle, break it up into multiple phases.
 - Make sure that each phase implements an asset that delivers new business functionality instead of adding incremental functionality to an existing asset. 

## Sell good news

If you are migrating a legacy IT system to cloud or virtual infrastructure, you should be making significant budget savings. In general, all finance cash-flows can be changed with the right process and procedure: normally, taking a budget amendment to your board with finance support. Making significant savings is a good news story that should help you achieve a budget amendment. 

## Communciate informally and frequently

 - Using capital funds to partly fund cloud or virtual infrastructure is still a new development, so there are still differing interpretations of what's allowed. 
 
 - Help finance avoid surprises. Communicate frequently with your finance and capital investment project staff so they don't feel pressured into making a safe or conservative ruling.
