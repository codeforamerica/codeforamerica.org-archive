A city website should let a resident to do everything they can do at city hall from the device of their choice, at any time and any place. 

"Everything you can do at city hall" is a lot, though, and cities have to start somewhere. A good way to start is by using your website analytics to find out what people are coming to your city website to do in the first place.

## What do people look for on city websites?

Our digital front door team recently [completed a survey](http://digifrodo.tumblr.com/post/101788428227/what-are-people-looking-for-on-city-websites) of about 1,000 residents of Oakland (0.25% of the population), asking about the ways they use to access the web and their past experiences with the City of Oakland website. 

We asked our respondents if they had ever visited the official Oakland website, and if they had, what they were doing the last time they visited. We have about 800 free-text responses to the question, and we categorized them according to the rough taxonomy of key city website topics we created a few months ago. (In a different part of the survey, we asked participants to identify which of the key topics were important to them.)

This right here is all 800 categorized responses, in free text. A couple of things to note: about 10% of responses did not fit our rough taxonomy (see the “Other” tab at far right). A brief look at the most common items there shows that city events and tasks related to housing are high on the list. That will help us prioritize.
Further, after a few hours copying and pasting the free-text responses, a pattern jumped out: a large number of the text snippets seemed to begin with either “looking for” or “trying to” rather than just “doing X”. I wondered (though I have no benchmark) whether these tentative terms are a fair barometer of uncertainty on a website, so I ran the numbers. 37% of respondents began their statement with one of these two phrases. I’m very curious to see if our work on the DFD will bring that percentage down if we re-run the survey in the future.
