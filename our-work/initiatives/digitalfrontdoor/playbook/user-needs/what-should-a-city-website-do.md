The internet has changed and improved many aspects of peoples' lives: from education to commerce, from transportation to employment. Cities must now also meet their residents where they are spending more and more time: online.

A city's website is its digital front door. It's a place for it to do business with its residents, a city hall that can be accessed from any location and at any time. Websites are a way to provide the services and information that residents need simply, clearly and quickly. 

In this guide, we'll cover general principles for city websites, how to start publishing effective web content, and how to prioritize transactional needs.

## General principles and goals for city websites

Based on our [Principles for 21st Century Government](https://www.codeforamerica.org/governments/principles/), here are 9 principles and goals for city websites:

### 1. Embrace digital services as central to governing

 - Government services should be “digital by default,” available to us on the mainstream platforms and technologies we already use.  
 - Services should be useful, accessible, and add value to our lives.
 - Government should do more than broadcast out. Tools should make room for interaction, feedback, and resident participation.

### 2. Design with empathy, establish trust

 - Government service design should reflect a respect for our time, dignity, and abilities.
 - When the act of renewing a driver’s license, filing a request, or getting a business license is pleasant, residents begin to trust and appreciate government.
 - Services should be compelling enough that people prefer to use them.
 
### 3. Serve everyone

 - Government services should be designed to reach as many residents as possible regardless of income, location, language, or access to technology.
 - Government employees should get out of the building, test assumptions with real residents, and tweak service design to improve it on a regular basis
 
### 4. Encourage participation

 - Governments and residents should share in decision-making and service design.
 - Services should be built to anticipate participation from employees and residents in the design and development process.
 
### 5. Be transparent and accountable
 
 - Let residents and staff see and support what’s going on in government, whether it’s purchasing data, viewing open source code, or accessing open data portals.
 - Governments should be clear on the goals of a service and identify areas that can be measured, displayed, and improved on by employees and the public.
 
### 6. Build for flexibility, welcome change
 
 - Online services are an ongoing investment that require attention and modification over time
 - Government services should be launched as evolving pilot projects rather than one-time massive monoliths.
 - Cities should invest in ongoing research, maintenance, and development and should have the internal support to push regular technology upgrades.
 
### 7. Create better processes and policies

 - The best government technologies should be easy-to-use and useful in a city employee’s regular work routine.
 - Government technology should reduce overall workload and increase the efficiency of city employees.
 - City policies should support the creation and deployment of better online services.

### 8. Unlock the capabilities of government employees

 - Governments should expect city employees to tweak and improve on city services.
 - Innovation, technology maintenance, and service design should be a responsibility of all employees, rather than the realm of one group or department.
 
### 9. Get value for tax dollars

 - Whether through short-term trials or pilot programs, no system or vendor solution should be deployed en masse without evidence of success.
 - When investing in technology, cities should consider their internal skills and ability to maintain and upgrade that technology in the future.
 - Governments should reduce barriers to the contracting process and encourage greater competition amongst vendors in order to increase options and drive down the cost of technology.
 
## Serve residents' needs

Effective city websites serve their residents' needs by identifying and thinking about the effective delivery of real user needs. People come to city government websites to accomplish specific tasks and to fulfil needs - even when those needs may at first seem vague. 

When we talk about cities serving residents' needs, we explicitly mean residents, not government. Example resident needs might include choosing a school, starting a new business or paying a bill. 

Every page on a city website should be simple, clear and contain all the information that someone might need. 

## Make it easy for everyone to participate

City websites are another platform that government can use to collaborate with the community and seek participation from all residents in decisions that affect them. The language that you use on your website should be easy to understand, and city websites should be designed to support multiple languages. 

## Be produced iteratively

People expect information on city websites to be up-to-date and correct. The infrastructure behind your website must encourage and make it easy to update the content on your website so that it is correct.

Your city website should also be seen as a continual work-in-progress. Your work can be seen in two phases: foundational work where you are identifying large, current problems and fixing them, and then a new rhythm of operations, where the website is continually iterated and improved upon to better serve existing needs, react to new needs and to monitor and improve performance and security.

## Use data to decide what to do

City websites are already used by residents, which means decisions can be made using real behavior. Your website should provide you with actionable analytics data that helps city employees decide how to design their website to best serve user needs. 

## Publishing effective content

Above all, your content will be effective if it helps your users accomplish their specific need. A large part of publishing effective content is in identifying the right and specific need in the first place. 

Generally, city websites should only publish content that serves a clear resident need and:
 - is information or a service only provided by the city
 - explains what people, businesses or professionals can do, need to do, or need to do before they can do something
 - is about something regulated by the city
 - explains the purpose of a city organization
 - is, or is about, something the city provides, does or pays for

Use a [survey](http://www.codeforamerica.org/our-work/initiatives/digitalfrontdoor/guides/survey.html) to determine what the most common needs your residents have when they're visiting your website. You can also learn a lot from [web analytics](http://www.codeforamerica.org/apps/city-analytics-dashboard/). 

Make sure your staff have a communication plan so you can start building a practice of producing effective and understandable content. This strategy should include: 
 - a reading age standard (we recommend 9 years old)
 - a requirement to write in plain English that is easy to understand, without jargon or technical terms
 - advice to write in short sentences of up to around 25 words

You should run user research at all stages of content development to make sure that what is being published fulfils your residents' needs. 

## Prioritizing transactional needs

The simplest way to prioritize which government transactions to improve or deliver via your website is by volume of transactions across channels, but frequently this information doesn't exist. If it doesn't, your first action should be to run a [survey](http://www.codeforamerica.org/our-work/initiatives/digitalfrontdoor/guides/survey.html) and to examine the analytics data for your website.
