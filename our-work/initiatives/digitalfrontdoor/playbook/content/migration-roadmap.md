Your online content is a representation of your city and the services it delivers. During a website redesign, you are not just migrating over old content one time- it is an ongoing process where content will be continuously analyzed, updated, refined, and even deleted. Below is a recommended roadmap for building great content on your site. 

###1. Understand User Needs
Start with understanding your users’ online needs. By conducting an online resident survey, you can assess the devices and types of internet access used in different parts of your city, evaluate user needs to prioritize content development on your site, and understand where your city has strong and weak connections to users of its website. 

Check out our [Run an Online Survey Guide](http://www.codeforamerica.org/our-work/initiatives/digitalfrontdoor/playbook/user-needs/run-a-resident-survey.html) to learn more about what kinds of questions to ask, and how to run the survey. You should aim for a response from at least 1 in 1,000 residents, with geographic, ethnic, and age distributions similar to your [city’s census data](http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/download_center.xhtml). 

Analyze the results of your survey to make sure you are achieving responses that are representative of the entire community. Using zip code data and any socio-economic data collectived from the survey, identiy gaps in your reacy, and work to disseminate the survey to groups who were not accounted for during the initial outreach. You can use tactics in our [civic engagement standard](http://www.codeforamerica.org/governments/principles/engagement/) to have better reach and a more holistic sample of the community.

In 2014, Code for America worked with the [City of Oakland](http://digifrodo.tumblr.com/post/101788428227/what-are-people-looking-for-on-city-websites) to conduct a resident survey.  



###2. Conduct a Content Audit
Conducting a content audit provides a quantitative understanding of how various webpages on your site are performing. It can help you determine which pages need to be pruned or consolidated on your site, which pages need to be rewritten, which pages are the most heavily trafficked, identify any gaps, and much more. 

In general, your content audit process should: 

* Collect all URLs on your site. 
* Gather KPIs and other information for each page. We suggest using both our [City Analytics Dashboard](https://www.codeforamerica.org/apps/city-analytics-dashboard/), a free tool that runs on Google Analytics, and [URL profiler](http://urlprofiler.com/), a free third-party tool that will gather various metrics, including:
	* Bounce Rate
	 * Exit rate
	 * Unique visitors
	* Word count
	* Sentence count
	* Grade level
    * Number of visits 
	
* Analyze your content based on its metrics. Assign a specific action to each URL-- such as "keep", "remove", "update", etc. 

###3. Develop a Content Strategy 
From your content audit, you should have identified your top performing pages. As you build out your content strategy, track progress against these pages. 

Your content strategy should consist of key values that can guide decisions you make about your web's content. This should include: 

* goals for your content 
* identifying a point person (or department) that will see individual pages
* a plan for regularly updating your content
* strategies to collect on-going feedback from users about your website
* criteria for when content can be archived or deleted 
* on-going plans to train and empower best practices around writing for the web 


###4. Create Internal Content Tools
 * Style guide
 * Reading level tools

###5. Hold Content Writing Sessions

The technical aspects of your website are just one component of your site. At its core, a good city website means that information is accurate and easy to understand. This begins with building a strong writing culture and supporting your staff to be confident web writers. 

To do this, we recommend holding content writing workshops to help your team build capability in writing for the web. During these sessions, you can go over your style guide, analytics around your webpage, and hold group exercises to practice writing in a consistent, unified voice.  

Ideally, you should identify one representative from each department to serve as the deparment's designated writer and attend the content workshops. Your writers should have subject matter expertise in the content, some familiarity with (or interest in learning) technology, and an interest in professional development opportunities. 

Having writers from the departments of your website's most heavily trafficked pages is essential. However, for some departments, it may make sense your city's public information officers can maintain their content. This may include departments with low-traffic (or few) pages, or departments ill-equipped to have a designated writer (i.e. the Fire Department).
