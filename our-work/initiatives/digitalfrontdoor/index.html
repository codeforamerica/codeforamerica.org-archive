		<h3>Oakland, CA Pilot Partnership</h3>
				
		<p>A city’s website is the online equivalent of city hall: its digital front door. But too often, municipal websites are hard to navigate, cluttered with outdated information, and unable to process key public services. Code for America’s Digital Front Door initiative is working to make government websites no longer be *about* the government, but to *be* the government itself.  Join us in our efforts to rethink government websites and improve the experience for both citizens and city employees. </p>
		
		<h3>What We're Doing</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://digifrodo.tumblr.com/"></a>Partnering  with the City of Oakland</a> on a website redesign project that will help them understand their residents’ online user needs, create an alpha site, and help them navigate procurement issues to hire a local design firm. You can <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/our-work/initiatives/digitalfrontdoor/oakland-phase1-report/">read up on our work</a> from phase 1 of the project. </li>
		<li>Developed a free, open source City Analytics Dashboard to bring staff closer to their online constituents in the "virtual city hall" and to create an opportunity for direct feedback on the work they do online. This Dashboard has been <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/2015/02/05/making-virtual-community-members-visible-with-google-analytics/">adopted</a> by the City of Oakland and X other cities. </li>
		<li>Launching a Digital Front Door Community of Practice through our <a href= "http://www.codeforamerica.org/about/peernetwork/">Peer Network</a>, an online discussion forum for local government staff to discuss their own website redesign initiatives and share best practices. Join the discussion here. </li>

			<h2>Goals for the Digital Front Door</h2>
			<p>We put together a list of nine principles for cities that want to launch a Digital Front Door. Every city that launches one agrees to:</p>
			<ul>
				<li style="background-image:none;padding-left:0;"><h3>1. Embrace digital services as central to governing</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Government services should be “digital by default,” available to us on the mainstream platforms and technologies we already use.</li>  
						<li>Services should be useful, accessible, and add value to our lives.</li>
						<li>Government should do more than broadcast out. Tools should make room for interaction, feedback, and citizen participation.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li style="background-image:none;padding-left:0;"><h3>2. Design with empathy, establish trust</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Government service design should reflect a respect for our time, dignity, and abilities.</li>
						<li>When the act of renewing a driver’s license, filing a request, or getting a business license is pleasant, citizens begin to trust and appreciate government.</li>
						<li>Services should be compelling enough that citizens prefer to use them.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li style="background-image:none;padding-left:0;"><h3>3. Serve everyone</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Government services should be designed to reach as many citizens as possible regardless of income, location, language, or access to technology.</li>
						<li>Government employees should get out of the building, test assumptions with real citizens, and tweak service design to improve it on a regular basis.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li style="background-image:none;padding-left:0;"><h3>4. Encourage citizen participation</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Governments and citizens should share in decision-making and service design.</li>
						<li>Services should be built to anticipate participation from employees and citizens in the design and development process.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li style="background-image:none;padding-left:0;"><h3>5. Be transparent and accountable</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Let citizens and staff see and support what’s going on in government, whether it’s purchasing data, viewing open source code, or accessing open data portals.</li>
						<li>Governments should be clear on the goals of a service and identify areas that can be measured, displayed, and improved on by employees and the public.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		
		<div class="layout-minim">
			<ul>
				<li style="background-image:none;padding-left:0;"><h3>6. Build for flexibility, welcome change</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Online services are an ongoing investment that require attention and modification over time.</li>
						<li>Government services should be launched as evolving pilot projects rather than one-time massive monoliths.</li>
						<li>Cities should invest in ongoing research, maintenance, and development and should have the internal support to push regular technology upgrades.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li style="background-image:none;padding-left:0;"><h3>7. Create better processes and policies</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>The best government technologies should be easy-to-use and useful in a city employee’s regular work routine.</li>
						<li>Government technology should reduce overall workload and increase the efficiency of city employees.</li>
						<li>City policies should support the creation and deployment of better online services.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li style="background-image:none;padding-left:0;"><h3>8. Unlock the capabilities of government employees</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Governments should expect city employees to tweak and improve on city services.</li>
						<li>Innovation, technology maintenance, and service design should be a responsibility of all employees, rather than the realm of one group or department.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li style="background-image:none;padding-left:0;"><h3>9. Get value for tax dollars</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Whether through short-term trials or pilot programs, no system or vendor solution should be deployed en masse without evidence of success.</li>
						<li>When investing in technology, cities should consider their internal skills and ability to maintain and upgrade that technology in the future.</li>
						<li>Governments should reduce barriers to the contracting process and encourage greater competition amongst vendors in order to increase options and drive down the cost of technology.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
