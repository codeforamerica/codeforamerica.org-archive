	<p>Cities must meet their residents where they are spending more and more time: online. Municipal websites are the digital front door to a city - a place for sharing information, conducting business, and collecting feedback about what residents want and need. Our Digital Front Door community is a group of local government practitioners who are redesigning municipal websites to improve the experience for both citizens and city employees.</p>
