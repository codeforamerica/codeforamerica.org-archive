	</div>

	<h3>Expert-led training by Code for America Staff/Tech Team</h3>
	<p>Code for America is helping cities to meet their citizens where they are spending more and more time: online.  An entire website redesign can be a daunting proposition, often taking years to complete. We have created a workshop series to help you with the practices and skills you need to define the goals of a city redesign as well as how to get started with an alpha to both prove out a better way to build city websites.</p>

	<h3>What is a DFD Alpha?</h3>
	<p>A DFD Alpha is a way to address a resident need with a new approach. It allows you to reduce risk, try new ideas and develop better practices around using your website for core city needs.</p>
	<p>The best way to prepare for your city-wide website redesign is to create an alpha that lets you try out some ideas and get feedback early.</p>
