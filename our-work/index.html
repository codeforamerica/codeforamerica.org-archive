    <h2>What We Make</h2>

    <p>Code for America’s five programs – the <a href="/about/fellowship">Fellowship</a>, the <a href="/brigade/about">Brigade</a>, the <a href="/about/peernetwork">Peer Network</a>, our <a href="/about/startups">Civic Startups program</a>, and our <a href="/about/international">International</a> activities – produce a growing body of civic technology work.
</p>
<p>We create and deploy <a href="/apps">open-source software for local governments</a>. We convene discussions around <a href="/our-work/data-formats">data formats</a> for important issues such as restaurant ratings, housing code violations, transit, and trails. And we use the power of our network, across programs, to help cities tackle some of the most <a href="/our-work/initiatives">complex challenges</a> they face.
