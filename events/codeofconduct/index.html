    <h2>Code of Conduct</h2>

    <p class="layout-semibreve" style="padding-top:0px;">Code for America network activities and events should foster meaningful collaboration between participants, community members, and government partners.</p>

  <div class="layout-breve">
    <p>The Code for America community expects that Code for America network activities and events:</p>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>Are a safe and respectful environment for all participants.</li>
        <li>Are a place where people are free to fully express their identities.</li>
        <li>Presume the value of others. Everyone’s ideas, skills, and contributions have value.</li>
        <li>Don’t assume everyone has the same context, and encourage questions.</li>
        <li>Find a way for people to be productive with their skills (technical and not) and energy. Use language such as “yes/and”, not “no/but.”</li>
        <li>Encourage members and participants to listen as much as they speak.</li>
        <li>Strive to build tools that are open and free technology for public use. Activities that aim to foster public use, not private gain, are prioritized.</li>
        <li>Prioritize access for and input from those who are traditionally excluded from the civic process.</li>
        <li>Work to ensure that all demographics present in the community are represented.</li>
        <li>Actively involve community groups and those with subject matter expertise in the decision-making process.</li>
        <li>Ensure that the relationships and conversations between community members, the local government staff and community partners remain respectful, participatory, and productive.</li>
        <li>Provide an environment where people are not subjected to discrimination or harassment.</li>
    </ul>
      
    </p>
    <p>Code for America reserves the right to ask anyone in violation of these policies not to participate in Code for America events or network activities.</p>
