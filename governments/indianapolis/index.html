    <p>The Code for America fellowship team is working with the Indianapolis Department of Public Safety to strengthen the relationship between law enforcement and the community it serves. The fellows aim it to enable stronger conversations and oversight around the most critical police professional standards information, and strengthening the existing feedback capabilities available to citizens.</p>

    <h3>Midyear Report</h3>
    <p>Trust is a critical resource in policing. The public’s perception of law enforcement impacts not only the tenor of their direct interactions with officers but their general willingness to follow the law. Critical to that trust is a belief that law enforcement is acting in a just and consistent manner. For the community to build that belief they require two tools: access to accurate information on the behavior of law enforcement and the ability to bring about change in how law enforcement acts. Read about how the fellows helping make this happen in their Midyear report.
