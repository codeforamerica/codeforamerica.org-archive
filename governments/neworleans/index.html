    <h2>The 2016 Fellowship in New Orleans</h2>
  </header>
  <p>In 2016 Code for America will work with the City of New Orleans to build digital tools to connect jobseekers, training providers,   and employers across New Orleans. </p>
  <p>The project is a partnership between Code for America, the City of New Orleans, and the Markle Foundation. as part of its <a href="http://www.markle.org/economic/rework-america">Rework America Connected initiative</a>, which aims to connect job seekers with the employers and training opportunities needed to engage with the high-growth, well-paying industries of the 21st century economy.  </p>
  <p>The team will work closely with the <a href="http://www.thenetworkneworleans.org/">Network for Economic Opportunity</a>, an initiative launched by Mayor Landrieu in 2013 to reduce inequities and increase economic outcomes across socioeconomic, racial, and geographic lines. The project will include analysis of job descriptions in New Orleans Workforce Investment Board job postings, examining the correlation of common job requirements language with the skills and experience needed to succeed in these jobs, and identifying factors, including wording, placement, and promotion of job postings, that contribute to bias and reduce applications by qualified applicants to these jobs. </p>

<p> For more information on the 2016 Code for America Fellowship see the  <a href=“http://c4a.me/2016”>announcement</a>.</p>

    <h2>The 2012 Fellowship in New Orleans</h2>
  </header>
  <div class="layout-minim">
    <p>Blighted and abandoned properties are more than just eyesores — they attract crime and decrease property value. In 2012, the City of New Orleans had more than 35,000 derelict and abandoned properties with little information to track their demolition or restoration. Citizens who wanted blight-related information could either spend hours on the phones with City Departments or wade through a series of confusing websites.</p>
    <p>A woman named Rita Legrand went so far as to attend 400 property code violation hearings hoping that administrative judges would do something in her community. When asked to create a public record of blighted properties, government officials estimated the project would take three years to build and would cost millions of dollars.</p>
    <p>In six weeks, Code for America fellows <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/2012-fellows/">Amir Reavis-Bey, Eddie Tejeda, Alex Pandel and Serena Wales</a> joined city officials Allen Square and Denise Ross and built <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/?cfa_app=blightstatus">Blightstatus</a>.</p>
    <p>What was originally slated to be a multiyear, multimillion dollar effort became something that brought community members together. The apps was so successful that it was accepted as a Code for America <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/incubator-2/">incubator company</a> and has since spun into a startup called <a href="http://civicinsight.com/">CivicInsight</a>.</p>
    <p>Other apps that emerged from the fellowship year include a <a href="http://www.nola.gov/ready/">disaster preparedness program</a> and a <a href="https://github.com/amirbey/doctosoc">tool to sync open datasets</a> to the <a href="https://data.nola.gov/">data.nola.gov</a>.</p>
