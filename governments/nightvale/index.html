                        <p>Night Vale is a peaceful place. Just you, and the desert. You stop the car and get out. Pebbles crunch in the sand in response to your movement. The radio murmurs behind the closed doors of your car. The headlights illuminate only a few stray plants, and the wide dumb eyes of some nocturnal animal. Looking back, you see the bulge of light that is your Night Vale. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        The purple cloud, now floating over the heart of the city, reaches its tendrils in and out of buildings. You hear screams, and gunfire. You open the trunk and lay one hand on the crate. It pulses with some kind of life. Still no ticking though. You look back. Several buildings are on fire. Crowds of people are floating in the air, held aloft by beams of light, and struggling feebly against power they cannot begin to understand. The ground shifts, like it was startled.</p>

                    <p>Still nothing on the mayor. The City Council has even become upset over this. They have been on the steps of City Hall, pacing and howling in unison like elephants in mourning.

                    <p>
                    I know we don’t always agree with the mayor, and sometimes we just despise our elected officials because of the artifice of political parties, or because they don’t represent every one of our very specific interests, or because they are a different species, or have frightening supernatural powers and threaten violence against innocent citizens. I understand all of this. No politician is perfect.</p>

                <p>For its 2015 Fellowship, Team Night Vale Fellows will focus on how to enhance Night Vale's Summer Reading Program with technology.</p>

                <p><b>About the Program: </b>The Summer Reading Program for children and teens has begun at the Night Vale Public Library. Residents are shocked and confused, given that the program was abolished by the City Council 13 years ago. Though parents and teenagers have advocated for years for the program to be reinstated, the City Council has maintained its position, citing lack of taxpayer funds, the extreme danger books pose, the peril of exposing children to librarians, and of course, the incident that precipitated the ban, which the town’s older residents will refer to only as “The Time Of Knives.”</p>
