                        <p>The largest City in North Carolina, Charlotte is the second largest banking center in the US with ten Fortune 500 companies calling the city home. The city is also host to tech giants like LendingTree, an ecosystem of startup groups like Packard Place, Queen City Forward and RevTech Labs and rich academic institutions like UNC Charlotte College of Computing &amp; Informatics.</p>

                        <p>As a 2014 partnership city in Code for America's Fellowship program, our aim is to support Charlotte’s efforts in citizen engagement and greater government transparency.</p>

                        <p>The Code for America team in the City of Charlotte is working to increase citizen engagement by providing citizens with access to relevant and accurate information. By helping citizens better understand what’s going on in their neighborhoods, when it’s going to happen, and why, cities can build trust through transparency and proactively incorporate constituent feedback.</p>
                        <p>The City of Charlotte currently pursues various methods of communicating civic information to its residents, such as sending out flyers, emails, brochures, and even tweets. However, these methods don't always adequately convey the most crucial details to whom it's most important. Jessica P., a Charlottean, told us that she arrived home one day to a door hanger on her front door informing her of upcoming construction on her street. She woke up the next morning to a construction crew tearing up her driveway. Jessica and other residents, such as Geoff Y., want more personalized information from the city, as well as a way to engage rather than being passive recipients of information. By interacting with and seeking feedback from community members, the 2014 Fellows have assembled a framework of the type of civic information citizens want to be able to access, as well as the ideal ways to get that information.</p>
                        <p>Enter <strong><a href="https://github.com/codeforamerica/citygram">Citygram</a></strong>, a geographically-relevant notifications platform powered by open data. It delivers notifications to citizens via SMS and e-mail based on the areas and topics of interest (e.g. traffic, public meetings, rezoning, etc.) that they've chosen. Citygram aims to serve two goals:
                         <ol>
                          <li>to share relevant information that people want  in a simple, elegant way.</li>
                          <li>to make raw data not only open, but also meaningful to people.</li>
                         </ol>
