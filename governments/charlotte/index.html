                                <p>In New Orleans, they created a website that gives residents up-to-date information on the status of vacant properties. In Philadelphia, they developed an app that lets citizens weigh in on government discussions via text message. And in Boston, they made mobile apps for parents to track the school bus in real time and for teachers to send students text reminders. Now, it’s Charlotte’s turn.
