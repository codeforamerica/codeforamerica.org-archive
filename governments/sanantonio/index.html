                         <p>San Antonio is the most visited city in Texas with historic sites like the Alamo and the country’s first railroad drawing crowds. Nevertheless, the city is no stranger to technology either — with cyber security, biotech and companies like RackSpace Hosting calling San Antonio their home.</p>
                        <p>The 2014 Fellows are partnering with San Antonio to rally the city's already strong tech community while working to increase community participation in government.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>Code for America will leave the City of San Antonio with a cool app that helps our citizens by fulfilling a service need for our Citizens and, ideally, likewise helps a business unit tasked with fulfilling that service.</p>
                    <p>More than that, though, they’ll leave us with a successful example of how agile methods can be applied to solve problems that are too small to survive our sometimes overly restrictive formal processes, governance structures, and organizational silos. Sure we’ll be capable of sustaining what they’ve built for us, but we’ll also have a new toolset to solve the next problem that comes our way.</p>

                        <p>San Antonio loves its neighborhoods. The way people interact with their neighborhoods has a huge impact on the neighborhood’s viability and the quality of life it provides for residents. Well-kept neighborhoods with vibrant social scenes are highly sought after; their property values increase, and businesses build up around them. The Fellows want to help residents come together and fix up their neighborhoods for themselves and the community at large.</p>
                        The goal of the Fellows' work in San Antonio is to empower residents to own the city they live in, and to give residents the opportunity to give fearless feedback and fix community problems themselves.

The Fellows believe these three elements are the key to encouraging people to take the first step toward improving their homes.</li>

                        In partnership with San Antonio, the Fellows are also helping the city continue its efforts to be more transparent and modernize its internal technology processes.
