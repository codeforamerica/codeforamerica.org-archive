      <h2>Team Building</h2>
      <p>When governments work in the open and proactively release public data in standardized formats, they can drive transparency, participation, and collaboration to help further key priorities. </p>

      <p>Open Government means that information is being shared proactivly in a user-friendly way, ensuring accessibility and understandability. By sharing information, governments can facilitate public dialogue and spur productive participation focused on key issues, allowing the community to help make government work better.</p>
