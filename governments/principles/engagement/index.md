Code for America works at the intersection of [civic engagement](/brigade/), [government](/about/fellowship/), and [technology](/apps/).
  
We build digital tools that improve the public’s interactions with government, and use those tools as a catalyst for structural changes that make government more open, more responsive, and more engaging.

We emphasize the role of the citizen not just as a passive recipient of government services, but as an active participant in building government.

We have seen glimpses of a better model of engagement working for government staff and the public across America. This Engagement Standard systematizes what we have seen work and offers both governments and residents concrete tools and tactics to use in their communities.

## Effective Civic Engagement Standard

We think there are five key elements of an effective, 21st century civic engagement strategy for local government. They are:

1. _Reach:_ Defining the constituency you are trying to reach, with an emphasis on identifying those whose voices aren’t already represented.

2. _Information:_ Providing relevant information that is easy to find and understand, and speak with an authentic voice.

3. _Channels:_ Making use of a diversity of spaces, both online and offline, that meet people where they are.

4. _Productive Actions:_ Identifying clear, concrete and meaningful actions residents can take to reach desired outcomes.

5. _Feedback Loops:_ Making sure the public understands the productive impact of their participation, and that their actions have value.

Governments must be proficient in all five areas to create meaningful relationships with *all* residents.

## What Success Looks Like

When cities fully develop these five capacities, we expect to see:

 - Measurable increases in the public’s satisfaction and trust in government.
 - Improvements in residents’ sense of efficacy - when they see a problem, they feel there is a path to fixing it.
 - Greater number and kinds of people who participate in public conversations.
 - A stronger consensus of support from the public for government policies, processes, services, and plans.
 - More engagement around public information.
 - A more collaborative, less antagonistic relationship between government and the public.
 - Public servants who feel they have capacity to engage the public in their work.

## 1. Reach

The first step in any engagement process is to define your target audience, based on the issue you are seeking engagement around and the constituencies whose voices are least represented on that issue in the current process.

### Reach checklist

 - Identify the issue you want to engage people around.
 - Understand which voices are being heard the least, or not at all, on the issue.
 - Decide how to identify and invite participation from those voices.
 - Map out community constituencies and their connections.
 - Identify the influencers within those communities.
 - Codify a plan to know who you are trying to reach and how.

### Reach tactics

 - Use your map to identify and build relationships with constituencies that are not engaged on this issue.
 - Compare your city’s [Census demographic data](http://censusreporter.org/) with the demographics that engage with the City in meetings and public comment. Build relationships with the unheard voices in the representation gap.
 - Start with the people least well-served by the issue status quo.

## 2. Information

A major reason the public doesn’t engage is because information about government activities is too obscure, too outdated and too hard to access. Local governments must set a narrative that is informative, inviting and authentic. Well-designed, plain language, and fresh, relevant content on an issue is a key part of the engagement process.


### Information checklist

 - When providing information or doing outreach, seek to answer or clarify the questions that constituents are asking repeatedly.
 - Communicate with an authentic voice in clear language.
 - Confirm that your language is relevant to different groups in the city.
 - Perform user-centered design research to understand if your information is presented in a compelling way.
 - Make it easy to track and update city information based on feedback.

### Information tactics

 - Conduct a review of all city information around the relevant issue or service, consolidate, and update.
 - Run a write-a-thon to engage many constituencies to do this in clear, people-centered language.
 - Work with ambassadors who can help make your message authentic and relevant to the groups you want to engage.

## 3. Channels

Where and how you engage with people can make or break your strategy on an issue. To make an issue inviting to public participation, plan to engage in many places and with many methods. Always remember above all else to meet people where they are.


### Channels checklist

 - [Meet people where they are](http://gretabyrum.com/files/greta_chatterbox.pdf), both in real space and online.
 - Identify where you can engage people [when the issue at hand is most tangible to them](http://blog.textizen.com/lisc-20150107/).
 - Support many ways for people to communicate with you and with each other on their own time.
 - Join people at community spaces they trust.

### Channels tactics

 - [Ask about transit at the bus stop](http://transitlab.osu.edu/data-collection/intercept-surveys), housing at a housing fair, and food policy at the farmers market and the SNAP office.
 - Find ways for people to engage whenever and wherever they choose.
 - Consider different access: mobile, ability, language, social norms.
 - Focus on spaces people trust, like churches, libraries, schools, and parks.

## Productive Actions

Whenever you engage, know how to make a hard ask for people to take a specific action with a clear desired outcome. Digital tools enable co-creation, co-design, and productive activity on a previously impossible scale for local government. Use these tools to show people they can participate in their government in a lot of ways, including building tools for public benefit. Make sure what you are asking people to do will actually add value to your work. Otherwise, you won’t use it and people will feel discouraged. Give people the right steps to take so they can see that their efforts move the issue forward.

### Productive Actions checklist

 - Establish concrete, productive, meaningful actions for people to take on the issue.
 - Enable a variety of methods for people to take action on the issue.
 - Make hard asks for people to take specific actions in a timely manner.
 - Provide ways for people to co-design tools and services with government.

### Productive Actions tactics

 - Create opportunities for the public to contribute to advancing desired outcomes. [Participating in your local Brigade](/brigade/) enables residents and public servants to work together on civic projects.
 - Build a standard practice for [civic user testing](http://www.cutgroupbook.org/), where residents can help test the usability of government services. For example, check out Civic User Testing (CUT) groups in [Oakland](http://cutgroup.openoakland.org/), [Chicago](http://www.cutgroupbook.org/), and [Chattanooga](http://tester.openchattanooga.com/).
 - Craft your hard ask to ensure intelligent actions and responses, [using tools like Textizen](http://blog.textizen.com/reno-20150331/).
 - Make [public data collection](http://localdata.com/case-gary.html) part of your productive action plan.

## 5. Feedback Loops

Feedback is how the public knows and trusts their input is making meaningful change in their community. If citizens can’t see that their investment of time resulted in a clear outcome they won’t be incentivized to participate again. Find ways to continue conversations with residents and build lasting relationships.

### Feedback Loops checklist 

 - Show people the influence of their investment and engagement on the issue.
 - Design the engagement process to produce actionable feedback.
 - Implement strategies to maintain and strengthen the relationships you create.
 - Implement a shared set of tools that keep residents in the loop about how their inputs are being used.
 - Think about the pathway you are creating to deepen residents’ engagement. Let this be the first of many opportunities to engage.

### Feedback Loops tactics 

 - Establish the method by which members of the public will [understand the outcome of their participation](/blog/2014/06/04/community-engagement-lessons-from-boston/).
 - Consider city officials as agents of community outreach, constantly building relationships and joining events even when not necessary.
 - Provide an opportunity for [instant feedback](http://blog.textizen.com/palo-alto-20150204/).
