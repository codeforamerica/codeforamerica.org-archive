    <h2>Civic Engagement at Code for America</h2>
  </header>

  <p>Code for America works at the intersection of <a href="www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/">civic engagement</a>, <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/about/fellowship/">government</a>, <a href="www.codeforamerica.org/apps/">technology</a>.</p>
  
  <p>We build digital tools that improve the public’s interactions with government, and use those tools as a catalyst for structural changes that make government more open, more responsive, and more engaging.</p>
  <p>We emphasize the role of the citizen not just as passive recipient of government services, but as active participants in building government.</p>
  <p>Neither government staff nor the public are satisfied with current modes of engagement.<!-- Jen's comment --> This is why citizen engagement is one of the top things cities ask for Code for America's help on.</p>
  <p>We have seen glimpses of a better model of engagement working in cities across America. Now is the time to systematize effective civic engagement.</p>
</div>
  
<div class="layout-semibreve">
  <h2>Effective Civic Engagement Standard</h2>
  <p>We think there are five key elements of an effective, 21st century engagement strategy. They are:
  
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Reach:</strong> Strategies to include all residents, particularly those who are typically excluded from participating.</li>
    <li><strong>Information:</strong> Provide relevant information that is easy to find and understand.</li>
    <li><strong>Channels:</strong> Make use of a diversity of spaces, both physical and virtual, that meet people where they are.</li>
    <li><strong>Productive Actions:</strong> Have clear and concrete actions residents can take to reach desired outcomes.</li>
    <li><strong>Feedback Loops:</strong> The public understands the productive impact of their participation, and that their actions have value.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>Governments must be proficient in all five areas to create meaningful relationships with <em>all</em> residents.</p>
</div>

<div class="layout-semibreve">  
  <h2>What Success Looks Like</h2>
  <p>When cities fully develop these five capacities, we expect to see:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Measurable increases in the public’s satisfaction and trust in government.</li>
    <li>Improvements in residents’ sense of efficacy - when they see a problem, they feel there is a path to fixing it.</li>
    <li>Greater number and kinds of people who participate in public forums.</li>
    <li>A stronger consensus of support from the public for government policies, processes, services, and plans.</li>
    <li>More engagement around public information.</li>
    <li>A more collaborative, less antagonistic relationship between the City and the public.</li>
    <li>Public servants feel they have capacity to engage the public in their work.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <!-- REACH -->
  <article><br /><hr /><br />
    <h3>1. Reach</h3>
    <p>Public servants should always ask what constituencies they do not have a strong relationship with. Using many methods of communication and working with community anchors, the City can cultivate an active dialogue with people who are least well-served by an issue and enlist their help to solve it an innovative way.</p>
    
    <h5>Checklist</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Identify the issue you want to engage people around.</li>
      <li>Understand which voices are being heard the least, or not at all, on the issue.</li>
      <li>Decide how to identify and invite participation from those voices. <!-- changed to reflect Bracy's comment re: identifying voices --></li>
      <li>Map out community constituencies and their connections.</li>
    </ul>
     
    <h5>Strategies</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Codify a plan to know who you are trying to reach and how.</li>
      <li>Use your map to identify and build relationships with constituencies that are not engaged on this issue.</li>
      <li>Start with the people least well-served by the issue status quo.</li>
    </ul>
  </article>
   
  <!-- INFORMATION -->
  <article><br /><hr /><br />
    <h3>2. Information</h3>
    <p>Reading or hearing information is the easiest way for a resident to learn about an issue. The City can help set a narrative that is informative, instructive, and inviting to participation. Creating and updating content on an issue is a key part of the engagement process, and can activate residents in their own homes and community spaces.</p>
    
    <h5>Checklist</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Answer the most frequently asked questions with your outreach.</li>
      <li>Communicate with an authentic voice in clear language.</li>
      <li>Confirm that your language is relevant to different groups in the city.</li>
      <li>Make it easy to track and update City information based on feedback.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h5>Strategies</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Conduct a <a href="assess-digital-services.html">census</a> of all City information around the relevant issue or service, consolidate, and update.</li> <!-- page not live until DFD week 2 branch is merged -->
      <li>Run a <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/honolulu-answers/">write-a-thon</a> to engage many constituencies to do this in clear, people-centered language.</li>
      <li>Source user stories from the people you want to engage.</li>
      <li>When you make your community constituency map, compare your city's Census demographic data with the demographics that engage with the City in meetings and public comment. Find unheard voices in the representation gap. <!-- from Migurski's comment --></li>
    </ul>
  </article>
  
  <!-- CHANNELS -->
  <article><br /><hr /><br />
    <h3>3. Channels</h3> <!-- temporarily changed "Forums" to "Channels," but recognize we need a bit more thinking here. "Spaces" is an alternative. -->
    <p>Where and how you engage with people can make or break your strategy on an issue. To make an issue inviting to public participation, plan to engage in many places and with many methods. Always remember above all else to meet people where they are.</p>
    
    <h5>Checklist</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Meet people where they are, both in real space and online.</li>
      <li>Identify when you can engage people where the issue will be most tangible.</li>
      <li>Support many methods for people to communicate proactively.</li>
      <li>Authentically join people at community spaces they trust.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h5>Strategies</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Ask about transit at the bus stop, housing at a housing fair, and food policy at the farmers market and the SNAP office.</li>
      <li>Find ways for people to engage whenever and wherever they choose.</li>
      <li>Consider different access: mobile, ability, language, social norms.</li>
      <li>Focus on spaces people trust, like churches, libraries, schools, and parks.</li>
    </ul>
  </article>
  
  <!-- PRODUCTIVE ACTIONS -->
  <article><br /><hr /><br />
    <h3>4. Productive Actions</h3>
    <p>The City should prepare the next plays on an issue for people to take. Whenver you engage, know how to make a hard ask for people to take a specific action with a clear desired outcome. Give people the right steps to take so they can see that their efforts move the issue forward.</p>
    
    <h5>Checklist</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Establish concrete, productive, meaningful actions for people to take on the issue.</li>
      <li>Enable a variety of methods for people to use their voices and hands.</li>
      <li>Know how to make the hard ask for people to take specific actions.</li>
      <li>Provide ways for people to co-design tools and services with government.</li>
      <li>Build a standard practice for <a href="http://www.cutgroupbook.org/">civic user testing</a>, where residents can help test the usability of government services. For example, check out Civic User Testing (CUT) groups in <a href="http://cutgroup.openoakland.org/"> Oakland</a>, <a href="http://www.cutgroupbook.org/">Chicago</a>, and <a href="http://tester.openchattanooga.com/">Chattanooga</a>. <!-- wonder if this one is a bit tangential --></li>
    </ul>
    
    <h5>Strategies</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>The critical moment for people to participate in government is at the point of clearly advancing towards a shared goal.</li>
      <li>Create opportunities for the public to contribute to advancing desired outcomes. These actions can range from collecting directed feedback on an issue to co-creating government services with residents.</li>
    </ul>
  </article>
  
  <!-- FEEDBACK LOOPS -->
  <article><br /><hr /><br />
    <h3>5. Feedback Loops</h3>
    <p>Feedback is how the public's input becomes a force for informed change. Find the ways that every engagement produces actionable feedback for both the City and the public. Residents become committed participants in government when they see their efforts are making a difference.</p>  
    
    <h5>Checklist</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Help people see the influence of their investment and engagement on the issue.</li>
      <li>Provide an opportunity for instant feedback in all directions.</li>
      <li>Design the engagement process to produce actionable feedback.</li>
      <li>Implement strategies to maintain and strengthen the relationships you create.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Strategies</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Residents must very clearly see the positive impact of their investment in engagement.</li>
      <li>Implement a shared set of tools that keep residents in the loop about how their inputs are being used.</li>
      <li>Consider city officials as agents of community outreach, constantly building relationships and joining events even when not necessary.</li>
    </ul>
