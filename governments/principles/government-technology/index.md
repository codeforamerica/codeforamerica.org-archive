One of the [Principles for 21st Century Government] (https://www.codeforamerica.org/governments/principles/ "Principles for 21st Century Government") is [Use the right technology for the job] (https://www.codeforamerica.org/governments/principles/#procurement "Use the right technology for the job"). The core of this principle sits at the intersection of interactions between government and vendors. 

The government technology ecosystem is at a pivotal point: the number and quality of govtech companies is increasing, and government interest in digital technology that works is rising. There is an unmet opportunity to move the market towards a government that works in the 21st century. 

Government purchasing is highly regulated to deliver accountability, value for money, fairness, security and transparency. However, it’s clear that these aims are not always delivered, and sometimes also result in technology that is not fit for purpose.

Listed below are seven principles that promote good digital products and practices in government technology. 

We’ve based these principles on how successful governments, vendors and products are working together to deliver 21st Century Government. 
    
### 1. Design for and with people

“Big IT” is what government is used to: expensive — up to hundreds-of-millions-of-dollars — slow to deliver and often unfit for purpose. When software and hardware is cheaper everywhere, government technology cannot be the exception. New Govtech products should deliver a significant improvement in pricing and value over legacy “Big IT.” These products, with successful practices, are deployed in weeks, not years. 

As well as price, massive  improvements in value can be delivered by:

*   vendors and governments using different business models
*   discovering new economies of scale and
*   delivery of services via the cloud. 

### 2. Deliver a significant improvement in pricing and value over “Big IT”

Big IT is what government is used to. Expensive — in the hundreds-of-millions-of-dollars range — slow to deliver and often unfit for purpose. When software and hardware is cheaper everywhere, government technology cannot be the exception. New Govtech products should deliver an immense  100x improvement in pricing and value over legacy “Big IT.”

As well as price, massive  improvements in value can be delivered by vendors and governments using different business models, and discovering new giteconomies of scale. 

### 3. Enable data-driven government

Governments should strive to monitor their services in real-time for speed, availability and effectiveness in achieving the aims of policy. To achieve this, New  Govtech products deliver relevant, actionable information using open standards so that government staff can evaluate the effectiveness of policies, tools and processes to better and more quickly serve the public.

### 4. Use and promote open standards

Open makes things better by making it easier to understand and examine services and to collaborate on improving them.  New Govtech products reject proprietary file formats and closed standards and instead use and promote open standards to deliver a collaborative digital platform for government. 

Requiring open standards also helps prevent  governments from being locked in to a particular product by making it easier to effectively export  usable data into another product. 

### 5. Contract quickly, clearly, and transparently 

Doing business should be easy, not hard. A long sales or purchase cycle is a symptom of an inefficient system. Governments and vendors both benefit when they are transparent about how long decisions will take. 

Processing and evaluation of purchasing should be reviewed based on their value-proposition- not just their final dollar amount. While there are many kinds of projects with varying degrees of complexity — from low-risk to high-risk and inexpensive to expensive — in general, contracts below the procurement threshold should be signed in no longer than:

*   30-60 days for state and local government* 
*   45-120 days for the federal government.*

Companies should additionally consider the benefits of being on the GSA Schedule for working with the Federal Government. 

RFPs must be written clearly and transparently, and must outline the problem to be solved, rather than the solution to be procured. This will give vendors the room for creativity and innovation in how they respond to the RFP. Also, involve Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) and stakeholders in the creation of the RFP as well as the selection and implementation process. Additionally, RFPs should be written for startups as well as established vendors to apply. 

New Govtech products strive to be easy to sell and easy to buy. Contract terms should:

*   Have easy to understand language.
*   Incorporate transparent, predictable pricing. 
*   Outline expectations for both parties, including ongoing maintenance and protocol for termination. Contracts should have effective escape clauses, change order procedures, include indemnity clauses to define limits for loss, and a clear process for settling differences.
*   Include flexible Intellectual Property (IP) arrangements and terms. Governments and vendors should consider licensing technology as another option to purchasing. Governments and vendors should consider a range of options for IP including  open source, but not limited to it.
*   Explicitly cover data ownership. For example this could be covered in the government’s Open Data Policy.

### 6. Deliver continuous improvement

New Govtech products are solutions that continuously improve. Improvement through regular, small iteration reduces risk, makes big failures less likely and turns small failures into lessons. 

By using services that continuously improve, government services can realize ongoing improvement for free, without having to do any heavy lifting. 

### 7. Don’t reinvent the wheel

Government’s focus should be on their core purpose. Technology can facilitate the delivery of government services. Government technology should be built using existing technology, when appropriate. This allows savings of funding, time, and resources. 

The builders of government technology don’t need to re-invent products or systems. Often aspects of a product can be implemented from external sources. For example, given that support resources need to be reliable and support expansion; cloud hosting may be the most effective option.
