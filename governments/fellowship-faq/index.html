                <p>The Fellowship is an 11-month program where cities collaborate with a team of talented researchers, designers and developers to build apps, inspire citizen engagement and increase capacity for city staff. Past apps have addressed economic development, healthcare, criminal justice, citizen engagement, transportation and more.</p>
                
                <p>City applications for the Fellowship open in January and close in March.</p>

                <p><h4>Eligibility and Selection Criteria</h4>
<p>In addition to basic requirements such as the ability to fund the Fellowship program, we're looking for US-based city and county government partners who exhibit strong leadership and an interest in providing support and guidance to our Fellows. We're also looking for those governments who are willing to co-develop a sustainability plan to ensure that apps are well-supported after the Fellowship ends. If you are not based in the USA, please visit the <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/about/international">International Page</a>.</p>

<p>Those partners committed to helping Fellows through briefings and introductions to internal stakeholders are preferred. Those interested in co-developing app sustainability plans post-Fellowship are also given preference.</p>
        
        <h4>Who are the Fellows?</h4>
<p>This year’s average fellow is 30-years-old with previous experience in design, development, research or project management. Fellows have come from Google, Apple and <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/blog/how-rackspace-supports-code-for-america-Fellows/">Rackspace</a> recently started a sabbatical program to support us. You can check out past Fellowship bios here: <a href="../../geeks/our-geeks/2013-Fellows/">2013</a>, <a href="../../geeks/our-geeks/2012-Fellows/">2012</a> and <a href="../../geeks/our-geeks/2011-Fellows/">2011</a>.</p>

<a name="outcomes"></a><h3>Outcomes and Apps</h3>

<h4>What outcomes can I expect from my participation?</h4>
<p>Only a few years since our first Fellowship and Fellowship cities have released <a href="http://brigade.codeforamerica.org/pages/opendata">1000+ open data sets</a>, instituted <a href="http://brigade.codeforamerica.org/pages/openimpact-government">progressive new policies</a> and created entire <a href="http://www.newurbanmechanics.org/">departments for innovation</a>. The immediate impact of the program may be measured in app users or number of times an app is deployed, but apps are just the beginning. A complete list of our yearly outcomes is available in our <a href="http://annual.codeforamerica.org">Annual Report</a>.</p>

<h4>What kinds of apps can I expect?</h4>
<p>In the past, Fellows have built a variety of <a href="../../apps">apps</a> to meet your city's needs. Those needs are assessed during the Fellowship residency when teams do extensive community stakeholder and city staff interviews. You can check out most of our apps from past Fellows</p>

<h4>How do I sustain my apps?</h4>
<p>The last month of the Fellowship is dedicated to helping you support your apps. In some cases we’ll <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/2012/07/12/a-city-partnership-extraordinaire/">train your staff</a> to support them while in other cases, support comes from a <a href="http://brigade.codeforamerica.org/">Brigade</a>, a community group, university, contractor, or a civic tech startup. The connections you make with local civic hackers both during the research phase of this project and beyond adds capacity to your existing IT strategy.</p>

<h4>Why are the apps open source?</h4>
<p>City apps built during the Fellowship are released as <a href="http://opensource.org/docs/osd">open source code</a> and can be redeployed by local volunteer <a href="http://brigade.codeforamerica.org">Brigade</a> groups. While it's true that other cities can download and tweak your app code, as a Fellowship city you'll help steer the app's functionality in a way that is customized to meet your unique needs.</p>

<h3>Your Commitments</h3>

<h4>What is the total financial investment that the city must budget for this program?</h4>
<p>The overall investment for the 2015 Fellowship is $440,000.  In most cases 50% of the investment is covered by the local government applying for the Fellowship--which helps cover for direct expenses for a team of three fellows (stipend, benefits, travel, training).  The other 50% is typically raised by the local government from community funders (corporations, foundations, individuals) in collaboration with Code for America covers the cost of administering the Fellowship program. Additional fellows placed on a team at the request of a local government require an incremental investment.  To discuss funding options for your Fellowship, email <a href="mailto:luke@codeforamerica.org">luke@codeforamerica.org</a> to learn more about how we work with Fellowship applicants to secure local funding.</p>

<h4>How much government staff time is required?</h4>
<p>Project success correlates to staff engagement. We ask that someone in a leadership position acts as the primary Fellowship contact. This person assists in briefing Fellows, collaborating on the app and engaging other government stakeholders for interviews/meetings. In addition to the key contact, Fellows may have info and resource requests from select city staff. This equates to between 20-40 hrs staff time.</p>
