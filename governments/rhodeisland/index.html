                        <p>Despite the relatively modest size of the population (~1 million), Rhode Island has 54 different Local Education Agencies (LEAs), or districts, each with its own unique challenges and opportunities. The Stateâ€™s Office of Digital Excellence have tasked the Fellows with exploring ways to improve parental engagement, highlight educational resources within the State, reduce brain drain, and bridge the digital divide.</p>
                        <p>During the month of February, the Fellows met with school faculty and staff, policy makers, thought leaders, and community members &mdash; over 150 people &mdash; and ran several focus groups to find common challenges across the state. The projects that emerged focus on improving the first impression and continuing relationship that residents of Rhode Island have with the education system:
                        <ul>
                         <li><strong>Ticket to RIDE</strong> (RIDE = R.I. Department of Education) is an application that turns the registration forms into a series of prompts to be answered during a train trip. Guardians are prompted for information about their child, themselves, their family situation (such as the need for free/reduced lunch), and the people that are connected to their families.</li>
                         <li><strong>MultiplyRI</strong> is an SMS-based system that allows people with cell phones to locate digital literacy classes and available computers, and find a cheap Internet service provider, by sending a text message containing their address.</li>
                        </ul>
