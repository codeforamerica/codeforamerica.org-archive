    <h2>About the Fellowship</h2>
    <p>The Fellowship program sends teams of technologists into local governments across the country to work full-time for a year in partnership with government officials. The fellows apply <a href="/governments/principles/">21st Century Government Principles</a> to important problems, focused on health, economic development, and safety and justice.</p>

    <h4>What do the fellows do?</h4>
    <p>Over the course of the project period, the fellows immerse themselves in the community, researching user needs, meeting with stakeholders, proposing solutions, and collaborating with the government to build technology using an iterative, user-centered, and data-driven approach.</p>
    </p>While the product of the Fellowship is typically an early stage application that improves the delivery of a government service or function, the process acts as a vehicle for driving cultural and structural change inside of government â€” encouraging innovation, improving tolerance for risk, and increasing the organizations capacity for transparency and engagement.</p>
