                <p>Cabot Cove is a small fishing village in Maine, who's principle industry is fishing and mystery diversification.  Despite the close-knit nature of the community there, the town suffers from an unusually high homicide rate, peaking in the years 1984 to 1996, exacerbated by an understaffed police force.</p>
                <p>Fellow will focus on criminal justice. They will partner with local law enforcement for the year. They will find new and innovative ways to harness the skills of citizen enforcers and haw-eyed retirees, and bring them to bear on crime solving in Cabot Cove.</p>
