                        <p>Pittsburgh is a post-rust belt success story, with a booming new economy centered around its universities, hospitals and philanthropic institutions. The city is poised to take the next step with a new administration dedicated to reinventing one of the least sexy but most central functions of government: procurement. Pittsburgh will work with a CfA fellowship team to use technology and user centered design to fundamentally change the outmoded and inefficient way it buys everything from software to paperclips.</p>

                        &ldquo;I am honored and excited that Pittsburgh is joining with Code for America to build the city's reputation for innovation and transparency. We look forward to working in particular on new approaches to procurement that drive increased community participation, and in so doing, build the digital capabilities of our great city. I know the Fellows can learn from us -- and us from them -- as we work together to make government better for city residents.&rdquo;

    				<p>The ways in which governments buy what they need is a fundamental part of how they function. Improving procurement requires addressing the basics, which carries implications for the ways governments provide quality service to their citizens. In February, the Pittsburgh fellowship team conducted user interviews with over 50 City employees as well as 25 local businesses. These conversations highlighted a few key problem areas shared across the board. You can read more about these findings in the midyear report.</p>
    				<p>Some of those problem aras include:</p> 
    				<ul>
    					<li>Businesses interested in working with the city cannot easily access information about work opportunities.</li>
					<li>Keeping track of all the different procurement procedures is anxiety-inducing for city staff.</li>
					<li>Lack of well-documented, easy to find instructions often leads to wasted effort on the wrong process and extended back-and-forth.</li>
					<li>It is hard for city staff to find information about existing contracts.</li>
					<li>The contract renewal process is lengthy, difficult, and non-transparent.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Tasked with making procedural and technological inroads with procurement in Pittsburgh, the Code for America fellows identified three distinct but related problem areas and are currently building out tools to help address them:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>The Marketplace</strong> - The fellows believe they can provide great value to city staff and the local business community by increasing the number of businesses who know about and respond to city opportunities. They have a working prototype called <a href="http://pittsburgh-purchasing.herokuapp.com/opportunities/">Beacon</a>, a centralized website to advertise work opportunities from all city departments.</li>
					<li><strong>The Playbook</strong> - The team wants to reduce anxiety and staff time creating contracting and bid documents by decreasing the amount of time it takes to move a new contract from selecting a vendor to final contract. As a guide during their research month in Feburary the fellows built <a href="http://codeforamerica.github.io/pittsburgh-procurement-explorer/">a click-through site</a> to help them understand the process, which led them to the product they are now developing as an atlas to navigate the procurement cycle.</li>
					<li><strong>The Inventory</strong> - Reducing the time it takes to look up information about a contract and helping purchasing agents manage and update contract information are the two goals the fellows have for creating a searchable, updated inventory. The prototype for this effort is called <a href="https://pittsburgh-purchasing.herokuapp.com/wexplorer/">Scout</a> as it helps people search the databse.</li>
