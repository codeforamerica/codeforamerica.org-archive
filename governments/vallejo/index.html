    <p>Vallejo has been recognized as one of the most diverse populations of any city in the United States. It was hit hard by the foreclosure crisis, and while the City Council passed the first structurally balanced budget in over a decade, Vallejo is still recovering from municipal bankruptcy. In this context of severely limited resources and reduced staff, Vallejo is partnering with Code for America to use technology and innovation to improve public safety focusing on building trust between the law enforcement and Vallejo residents.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;The Code for America fellowship is an opportunity for us to enhance communication and increase engagement, and to maximize public involvement and collaboration. The City Council and I are thrilled to have been selected after having made the application to Code for America a top priority this year. We look forward to the many possibilities that will surely come from this fantastic partnership.&rdquo;</p>

    <h3>Midyear Update</h3>
    <p>During our time in Vallejo, we saw many examples of ways in which the Vallejo Police Department, limited by tight resources, struggled to connect with the community in non-emergency contexts. Since February we have met with diverse members of the Vallejo community and have set up bi-weekly meetings with Vallejo Police Department management. We have also consulted with criminal justice experts and civic technologists since returning to San Francisco since so many people are talking about this topic in the national context as of late. </p>

    <p>BETA is an event for the fellows to discuss their midway progress.</p>
