                        <p>The Fellowship team in Long Beach is working with the City to reduce avoidable utilization of emergency resources and improve health outcomes. They learned from their research that, as in a number of other cities, a small percentage of the population in Long Beach disproportionately uses emergency services. In 2013, 52 percent of emergency medical calls came from only 10 percent of addresses.</p>
                        <p>To reduce high frequency or &ldquo;super-utilization&rdquo; of emergency medical services, the Fellows are building tools to facilitate high-touch human interventions. By using meta-data to identify areas where there is a high concentration of calls to first responders, their app empowers the city to proactively direct intervention resources to where it will be most impactful. The team explain their work this way: &ldquo;Technology alone is not the solution; an app to remind someone to take their medication wouldn’t be sufficient. These situations require a human being who can build a relationship and troubleshoot each individual case.&rdquo; Check out the Fellows&rsquo; <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/fw3q3cspg6lrxjy/LongBeach-MidYearReport.pdf" target="_blank">mid-year update</a> to learn more.</p>
