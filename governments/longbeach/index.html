                        <p>The City of Long Beach was recently named one of the top <a href="http://www.longbeach.gov/civica/press/display.asp?layout=4&amp;Entry=4038">10 Digital Cities</a> by the Center for Digital Government and Government Technology and has been exploring ways to optimize government services through technology for some time now. Long Beach is a large American city boasting a vibrant mix of cultures, communities and business activity — from the corporate headquarters of Molina Healthcare, SCAN Healthplan and Epson America to significant R&amp;D operations for The Boeing Company and Mercedes Benz, complemented by a rapidly growing startup community centered around clean tech and mobile technology development.</p>
                        <p>The City is also home to one of the top public universities in the West, California State University Long Beach, the Office of the Chancellor for the Cal State System and a public school district recognized as one of the best urban districts in the country.</p>
