                        <p><strong>Code for America Team Mesa</strong> has been exploring ways to engage disparate groups in the city. In their engagement with the city's residents, they heard concerns about participation in the legislative processes, the notion of “decisions being made behind closed doors, not hearing about things until after they’ve have been voted on”. It resonated deeply. Based on extensive research and feedback, the Fellows have been devoting their efforts towards solving this problem.</p>
                        <p><strong>You Are Here</strong> is an app for residents to learn about the area where they live. The perception of Mesa as not having a strong identity ties into the scale of the city and its diversities of population. By simply entering a user’s address, information such as a map of the district boundary, councilmember, ways to communicate with the councilmember, legislative items being voted on in the district and ways to show support or opposition to the measure appears. An educational component will be featured, explaining in a user friendly manner the often hard to understand jargon that is associated with legislation.</p>
                        <p>In addition to the work with the city of Mesa, the Fellows are collaborating with <strong>Arizona State University</strong> (ASU) to develop the first Code for America collaborative university partnership. This year, they will be designing an official ASU internship program focusing on civic tech to inspire the next generation of civic leaders and innovators at the collegiate level.</p>

                <p>For its 2014 fellowship year, Mesa is excited to have the opportunity to partner with Arizona State University, the first partnership of its kind in the fellowship program.</p>
                <p><strong>Arizona State University – Polytechnic Campus – College of Technology and Innovation (CTI)</strong><br/>
                ASU’s Polytechnic campus is home to more than 6,000 students exploring ASU’s professional and technological programs. Thousands of square feet of laboratory space make way for project-based learning.</p>
                <p>At ASU’s College of Technology and Innovation (CTI) they make things. They make things that matter. They make positive change. They make leaders. But most of all, they make ideas happen.</p>
