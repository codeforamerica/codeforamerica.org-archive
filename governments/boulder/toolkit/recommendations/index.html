    <h3>Additional recommendations</h3>
  </div>

  <a id="recommend-community"></a>
  <h4>1. Create a community</h4>
  <p>There are people in many different roles across government whose job includes managing civic engagement processes. Creating a community of these employees so they can share what they’ve learned about best practices, tools, and past results.</p>

  <a id="recommend-iterate"></a>
  <h4>2. Iterate, iterate, iterate</h4>
  <p>Agile project management is a way of managing projects that uses data to make decisions and regularly making changes to improve effectiveness.  Many engagement processes fail because an approach is decided entirely before the process begins. When participation doesn’t match expectations or goals it becomes very hard to change direction. By using an iterative or agile approach, you can make regular changes to your plan based on what the data tells you is most effective. This is why setting baselines and goals at the start of your project is important, as well as ongoing data collection, so you can understand what works and what doesn’t. You can find more about how to use agile management in government here.</p>

      <a id="tools-recordtrac"></a>
      <strong>RecordTrac:</strong> a website that streamlines the public record request process for both requestors and government staffers.
