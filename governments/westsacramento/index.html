                        <p>Located in the heart of one of the nation’s most productive farming regions, West Sacramento is partnering with Code for America to advance the regional food system. In West Sacramento's urbanized areas, many privately-owned vacant lots are not properly maintained, creating visual blight that facilitates dumping and other unwanted activities while discouraging investment in the community. The City has embraced the urban farm movement as a means of transforming blighted properties, while generating economic activity and increasing the amount of healthy, locally-produced food available to West Sacramento residents.</p>

    			<h2>The 2015 Fellowship in West Sacramento</h2>
    				<p>The goal of this partnership is to increase local awareness of, and consumption of food from, local farms and to make West Sacramento's urban farming success more easily replicable in other jurisdictions. Among other things, our project will help address food deserts by making it easier to start new urban farms, and enable local farmers to connect with their surrounding communities and promote the sale of farm-fresh produce directly to residents. </p>
    				<p>The fellows have been working with farmers, residents, and community partners learning how time-consuming it can be for aspiring farmers to find suitable farmland. Easing that process, in development is the <a href="http://codeforamerica.github.io/westsac-mid-year-report-draft/#prototype-land-locator">Urban Land Locator</a> which helps new farmers find and request vacant, under-utilized, farmable lots of land.</p> 
				<p>Even after those farms are in production many residents either aren’t aware of the farms’ existence, or don’t understand how to purchase food from the farms. The farmers, in turn, have focused their efforts on selling to existing retailers, diluting some of the potential community benefits from localized sales. In development is a <a href="http://codeforamerica.github.io/westsac-mid-year-report-draft/#prototype-farm-stand">Digital Farm Stand</a> to improve awareness and help urban farms better reach West Sacramento residents. Residents will be able to see what farms are growing, what they plan to grow, and provide feedback through whichever communication channel they prefer.</p>
