          <p>Located in the heart of one of the nation’s most productive farming regions, West Sacramento is poised in partnership with Code for America to advance the regional food system. In West Sacramento's urbanized areas, many privately-owned vacant lots are not properly maintained, creating visual blight. The City has embraced the urban farm movement and is searching for new means of transforming blighted properties, while generating economic activity and increasing the amount of healthy, locally-produced food available to West Sacramento residents.</p>

    <h3>Midyear Report</h3>
    	<p align="left">The goal of this years partnership is to increase local awareness for, and consumption of locally grown food. The fellows aim to make West Sacramento's urban farming success more easily replicable in other jurisdictions. Among other things, the project will help address food deserts by making it easier to start new urban farms, and enable local farmers to connect with their surrounding communities and promote the sale of farm-fresh produce directly to residents.</p>
