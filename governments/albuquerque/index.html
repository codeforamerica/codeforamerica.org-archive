                        <p>As New Mexico’s fastest growing city, Albuquerque is powered by lightning speed fiber internet, connecting businesses and residents to information like never before. By partnering with the Code for America fellows, the city plans to create new economic growth and job mobility tools for residents, highlight a path for businesses looking to relocate, and create a one stop shop process to help ease the bureaucratic burden for local startups.
