                        <p>In addition to trade and tourism, Miami-Dade County has a fast-growing technology sector and is eager to engage their tech talent in service of civic goals. In 2015, Code for America Fellows will work with the city and county to improve economic development and regulatory outcomes, enriching feedback loops and improving access to services with the goal of connecting local entrepreneurs to government, and building tools to streamline and improve how residents start and grow small businesses.

                        &ldquo;It is a privilege for Miami-Dade County to be Code for America’s first government partner in Florida. This collaboration will drive a more open government, stimulate economic development and improve the delivery of regulatory services to our community. Code for America is an organization that has successfully advanced these capabilities through technology and innovation and the organization will be an important partner in our ongoing work to make Miami-Dade County more open, transparent and efficient.&rdquo;
