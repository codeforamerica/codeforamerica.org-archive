              <p>"With trail data being set free, parks &mdash; many of them operated with small and strapped budgets &mdash; will also be able to develop apps that are useful and dynamic. You'll learn about trail closers before schlepping it to the park. Third-party apps will also emerge. An app might help you get to one trailhead by bike, find a place to lock it up and trail-run to a beach, suggest a good lunch spot, and then find a bus back to retrieve the bike. Or an app designed for trail runners or mountain bikers might help you find races, clubs or training events, or provide an easy way to report a cougar sighting or a down tree to park managers.The maps might also show nearby services—eateries, outfitters, transit stops, swimming holes, whatever. Think of it as Google Maps for trails and parks.</p>

              <p>[Version 1.0 of] the specification for the Open Trails standard is now complee...and Code for America is already working with parks and other interested parties to start collecting data and building out applications."</p>
