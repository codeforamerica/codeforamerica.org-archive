                <p><em>"One of the big things about Code for America is that it gives people whose motivation is to serve the public, a reminder of why they're here and a chance to talk to other people. You couldn't do Code for America if every city was its own lab. The fact that there's a shared training group, meetings where people talk to each other, cross talk, and that ability to meet others who are excited about the same things you're excited about -- that's a big part of what powers Code for America"</em><b> - Clay Shirky, Author</p></b>
                
                <p>“Open Data is critical to any strong government. The data belongs to the people. It needs to be open the from top level data all the way down into reports -- not just for the people who already know what's going on, but also for entrepreneurs to create opportunities and offer information and knowledge to the public. We have a standing executive order for all data to be open.”</em><b>  - Mayor Greg Fisher, <a href="../../cities/louisville">City of Louisville</a> (2013 Fellowship City)</p></b>

                <p><em>“It’s hard in any business, or government for that matter, to pull out dedicated resources just to focus on innovation, so this is an intentional way to do that.”</em><b> - Mayor Greg Fisher, <a href="../../cities/louisville">City of Louisville</a> (2013 Fellowship City)</p></b>
                
                
                <p><em>“The last person you want to ask is the person who works in the government. They’re the fish in the fish tank. They don’t see the water. The hallmark of all Code for America projects is, what is the user experience? How does it work? And is it inefficient or ineffective in some way?”</em><b> - Ted Smith, Director of the Department of Economic Growth and Innovation, <a href="../../cities/louisville">City of Louisville, KY</a></p> (2013 Fellowship City)</b>
                
                <p><em>"The Code for America project, in partnership with the two Kansas Cities, will further elevate this region into a major driver and competitor in the field of entrepreneurialism, innovation and technology; making the region even more attractive to businesses.”</em><b> - Mayor Joe Reardon, <a href="../../cities/kansascity">Kansas City, KS</a> (2013 Fellowship City)</p></b>
                
             <p><em>"Andrew and Ariel have been incredibly important resources for our region and the impact of their work will be felt long after this project wraps up. One of my top priorities as mayor is ensuring that city government is a conduit for success and prosperity and is not a paperwork impediment.  The fellows Andrew and Ariel have definitely helped move that priority forward."</em><b> - Mayor Sly James, <a href="../../cities/kansascity">Kansas City</a> (2013 Fellowship City)</p></b>

This has been one of the most incredible experiences in my professional career.”</em><b> - Karla Henderson, former Group Executive of Planning and Facilities, <a href="../../cities/detroit">City of Detroit, MI</a> (2012 Fellowship City)</p></b>


<p><em>“Code for America pioneered the approach of building a community of citizen entrepreneurs who could harness the transformative power of technology to address challenges faced by local governments.”</em><b> - Chris Vein, Deputy Chief Technology Officer for Government Innovation, The White House</p></b>

<p><em>“It’s about inserting a model of working, thinking, innovating into a culture that’s bound by our rules. It’s a kind of culture virus for innovation in government.”</em><b> - John Tolva, Former Chief Technology Officer, <a href="../../cities/chicago">City of Chicago, IL</a> (2012 Fellowship City)</p></b>

<p><em>“Code for America is not just about creating a bunch of apps. It’s connecting our citizens with our city.”</em><b>  - Amanda Deaton, Assistant Chief Administrative Officer, <a href="../../cities/macon">City of Macon, GA</a> (2012 Fellowship City)</p></b>

<p><em>“CfA has transformed the way I think about getting things accomplished in the public space. It’s introduced new concepts - of government as a platform, and lean startup - that, as a 20 years inside the bureaucracy government practitioner, have really changed the way I think about the work that I do.”</em><b> - Jeff Friedman, Co-Director of the Mayor’s Office of New Urban Mechanics, <a href="../../cities/philadelphia">City and County of Philadelphia, PA</a> (2011 and 2012 Fellowship City)</p></b>

<p><em>“As society grows more connected, the challenge for local leaders is to use that technology and social media to better inform and engage communities...We believe Code has tremendous potential to unlock the imaginations of thousands of citizens to improve lives all over America.”</em><b> - Damian Thorman, Former National Program Director, The John S. and James L. Knight Foundation</p></b>

<p><em>“This process, more than the apps, is what’s really cool. Opening the government up and working with the community – getting their buy-in – has been a game changer.”</em><b> - Forest Frizzell, Deputy Director for the Department of IT, <a href="../../cities/honolulu">City and County of Honolulu, HI</a> (2012 Fellowship City)</p></b>

<p><em>“One of the best parts about us being there was working with different people in the city. People that I didn’t even know were emailing the fire department saying ‘I’m so glad this exists.’”</em><b> - Emily Wright Moore, 2012 Code for America Fellow in <a href="../../cities/austin">City of Austin, TX</a> (2012 Fellowship City)</p></b>

<p><em>“I think the main legacy that we leave behind in Detroit is that these things are possible...Now people realize that by opening up data, other people can step up and build things that the city can’t afford to, and that people can benefit from data that sometimes seems mundane.”</em><b> - Prashant Singh, 2012 Code for America Fellow in <a href="../../cities/detroit">City of Detroit, MI</a></p></b>

The platform’s benchmarking capabilities are advantageous to elected officials because it allows them to provide residents with a clear explanation about why a certain change makes sense both financially and in terms of benefits to the entire community.  Any time an elected official can relate empirical statistical data to residents it provides a factual and historical rationale for why any type of change or project makes sense, and that the decision was not indiscriminately reached on a whim.”</em><b> - Dave Fried, Mayor of the Robbinsville, New Jersey Township</p></b>
