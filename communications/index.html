                <h3><strong>Boilerplate</strong></h3>

                <p>Founded in 2009, Code for America (CfA) is a national nonprofit that partners with local governments and citizens to foster civic innovation. By working to reinvigorate civic participation, accelerate the civic startup marketplace, facilitate collaboration between government leaders, and build new tools that enhance and strengthen communities, CfA is helping governments solve old problems in new ways. CfA is working towards a government by the people, for the people, that works in the 21st Century.&nbsp;For more information, watch Founder Jennifer Pahlka’s <a href="/ted" target="_blank">TED talk</a> or go to <a href="http://codeforamerica.org" target="_blank">codeforamerica.org</a>.</p>

                <h3><strong>Fellowship Overview</strong></h3>

                <p>While the private sector has evolved exponentially over the past decade, adopting new technologies and new ways of working, local governments haven’t adapted at the same rate. Code for America partners with local governments who are working to catch up. The program embeds community-minded engineers and designers inside local governments to collaborate with municipal leaders. Together they create and implement web applications and explore new approaches to local problems. A list of current government partners is available <a href="/governments/2014-cities/" target="_blank">here</a> and a list of current Fellows is available at <a href="/fellows/2014-fellows/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Code for America was founded by Jennifer Pahlka on September 24, 2009, you can read more about its formation in <a href="/2011/09/30/were-two/" target="_blank">this blog</a> post.</li>

                    <li>In 2011 Code for America held its inaugural Fellowship connecting 19 Fellows with three cities: <a href="../cities/boston" target="_blank">Boston</a>, <a href="../cities/philadelphia" target="_blank">Philadelphia</a>, <a href="../cities/seattle">Seattle</a>.</li>

                    <li>In 2012 Code for America connected 26 Fellows with eight cities: <a href="../cities/austin" target="_blank">Austin</a>, <a href="../cities/chicago" target="_blank">Chicago</a>, <a href="../cities/detroit/" target="_blank">Detroit</a>, <a href="../cities/honolulu/" target="_blank">Honolulu</a>, <a href="../cities/macon/" target="_blank">Macon</a>, <a href="../cities/neworleans/" target="_blank">New Orleans</a>, <a href="../cities/philadelphia/" target="_blank">Philadelphia</a>, <a href="../cities/santacruz" target="_blank">Santa Cruz</a>.</li>

                    <li>In 2013 Code for America embedded 27 Fellows within nine communities:&nbsp;<a href="../cities/kansascity/" target="_blank">Kansas City, Kan. + Kansas City, Mo.</a>; <a href="../cities/lasvegas/" target="_blank">Las Vegas</a>; <a href="../cities/louisville/" target="_blank">Louisville, Ken.</a>; <a href="../cities/newyorkcity/" target="_blank">New York</a>; <a href="../cities/oakland/" target="_blank">Oakland, Calif.</a>; <a href="../cities/sanfrancisco/" target="_blank">San Francisco</a>; <a href="../cities/san-mateo-county/" target="_blank">San Mateo County, Calif.</a>; <a href="../cities/southbend/" target="_blank">South Bend, Ind.</a>; <a href="../cities/summitcounty/" target="_blank">Summit County, Ohio</a>.</li>

                    <li>The 2013 Fellowship was the first time that Code for America collaborated directly with counties. It is also the first time that two cities have come together to work on a joint project: Kansas City, Kan. and Kansas City, Mo.</li>

                    <li>Code for America is funded by a variety of foundations, companies, and individuals.

                </ul><strong style="font-size: 16px;">Code for America has five programs:</strong>

                <ul>
                    <li>The <strong>Fellowship</strong>, CfAs flagship program, connects talented developers and designers with local governments to harness technology for public good. <a href="/about/fellowship">codeforamerica.org/fellowship</a></li>

                    <li>The <strong>Brigade</strong>&nbsp;is an organizing force for civic minded developers, designers, data scientists, and leaders who contribute their talents towards addressing the problems we see everyday.&nbsp; <a href="/about/brigade" target="_blank">codeforamerica.org/brigade-program</a></li>

                    <li>The <strong>Companies</strong> program: With more than $140 billion poured into the civic tech industry — we’re looking to find and support entrepreneurs to take advantage of it, and disrupt the current ways of doing business. <a href="/about/companies/" target="_blank">codeforamerica.org/startup-program</a></li>

                    <li>The <strong>Peer Network</strong> is a professional learning community for local government innovators who share the common goal of taking innovation in their city to the next level. Through the Peer Network, Code for America connects local governments around the country to facilitate peer learning, collaborative problem-solving, and the spread of innovation best practices between cities. <a href="/about/peernetwork" target="_blank">codeforamerica.org/pn-program</a></li>

                    <li>The International or <strong>Code for All Program</strong>: Partners from around the world are using Code for America’s resources and lessons learned to transform their own communities by improving local governments. Launched in 2013, this program is quickly gaining momentum. <a href="/about/international/" target="_blank">codeforamerica.org/international</a></li>

                <h3><strong>Key Messages</strong></h3>

                <p></p>

                <ul>
                    <li>The private sector has evolved exponentially over the past decade adopting new technologies and new ways of working. However, local governments haven't adapted at the same pace, and have fallen behind.</li>

                    <li>Code for America connects developers and designers with forward-thinking local governments looking for ways to keep pace with the community they support.</li>

                    <li>Code for America Fellows along with city staff, city leadership, community groups, and constituents work together to figure out what issues need attending to, and what applications need building.</li>

                    <li>It’s not about the apps. Often the applications created are the most tangible result of Code for America’s partnership with a municipality. However, the partnership is truly about breaking down silos within city hall, fostering better collaboration between city hall and city residents, and developing new approaches to local challenges.</li>

                    <li>With inflated populations and dwindling budgets, governments have fewer resources now more than ever; Code for America helps discover ways of doing more, with less.</li>
