<h2>Ensuring a Successful Fellowship Project</h2>

<p>CfA works to establish a strong leadership team working in the city government to support fellows. The criteria for this strong leadership team is that they have <b>internal influence</b>, <b>subject matter expertise</b>, and are <b>trained in the fellowship process</b>. This helps there to be a clear understanding at all levels about how the fellowship works. It’s important to remove perceived and/or structural blockers to people’s support or involvement in the program. </p>
<p> Other partners may include foundations, nonprofits, and corporate sponsors. It’s advisable to involve these groups in conversations with the city early on, not just about fundraising for the program, but also about the project itself. Many of these groups will have a lot of subject-matter expertise and deep roots in the community.  </p>

<p>The involvement of non-government partners should be carefully managed to strike a balance between giving the fellows an appropriate amount of autonomy by ensuring partners don’t impose their own agenda but also cultivating a healthy collaboration between the two. It’s important to reinforce a focus on the citizen and government’s role in providing for citizens, not on any one partner’s agenda.  </p>

<h4>Preparing Government Partners for the Program</h4>

<p>It’s important to get everyone on the same page and set the stage for the fellowship program to be a success. Setting up the right team support structure within government for the fellows, fostering continued government engagement, and encouraging ongoing participation are all crucial for this piece. We do this through:</p>
<ul>

<li>Periodic emails with relevant information</li>

<li>Creating a government google group as a forum for Q&A</li>

<li>Formal orientation webinars (one per city)</li>

<li>Creating a Fellowship Guidebook</li>

<li>Conference calls with government staff to discuss program scope</li>

<li>On-boarding sessions</li>

<li>Inviting City Parnters to attend our annual Summit to be a part of the community</li>

<li>Site visits of CfA staff to partner cities</li>

</ul>
<p>We heavily rely on the fellows to push the project forward once the project has started, but CfA staff is very involved. CfA staff works continuously to support government partners overcome obstacles, get others excited about the program, and give advice about how to more productively engage with fellows.  In the future, Code for America is looking at ways to more concretely support cities throughout the program through more trainings and moretargeted engagement during the course of the Fellowship program.</p>

<h4>Scoping out a Project </h4>

<p>Correctly scoping a project for the fellows to work on takes time. Often, CfA must work with city partners to help them broaden the focus of their project, to allow fellows the opportunity to work towards emergent outcomes. Many city partners come to us with a specific app or product that they'd like the fellows to build, and we must explain that is not how the fellowship program operates. Code for America makes sure no decisions are made about the exact technology platofrms that will be used or the specific products developed for the project. Instead, we try to identify initial technological issues, digital skill gaps (Google Analytics, user research, etc.), project goals, focus areas, and desired outcomes. </p>
