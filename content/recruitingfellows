<h2>Recruiting Fellows</h2>

<p>Paying fellows sub-market wages makes it difficult to lure candidates away from their high-paying jobs in the tech sector. It is also hard for candidates to voluntarily uproot their lives and relocate to a new city, especially if they have families or community ties. Strong recruitment strategies can help with this. These include:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Make an emotional appeal.</b> Advertise the program as an opportunity to make a difference and be a part of a bigger network of changemakers. Highlight the opportunities for learning about local government, problem solving, and using technology for good.</li>
<li><b>Engage the press.</b> Develop relationships with both national and local press outlets to pitch stories. We create press releases, share stories with local press and/or local leaders who would be willing to share our message. </li>
<li><b>Run an email recruitment campaign.</b> Simple but effective: collect email addresses of prospective applicants and advertise the program via email. (Code for America currently manages a listserv of over 15,000 civic technologists). </li>
<li><b>Leverage your network on social media.</b> High profile mentors and advisors can help you create buzz around your program (a tweet, a post or a phone call on behalf of these figures are all great ways to get the word out). Have them back your cause across many platforms and reach out to their own networks to support of your efforts. </li>
<li><b>Hold events and invite high-profile guests.</b> Host gatherings and events to promote the program. Over the years, CfA has built up mentors from government and the tech world.  These endorsements are crucial to our recruitment success. </li>
<li><b>Promote your cause at other events.</b> This might mean going to conferences or speaking at events hosted by local tech companies.</li>
<li><b>Make relocation easy. </b>Provide logistical support to help fellows relocate during the fellowship. Make the transition as smooth as possible by helping them find housing,  transportation, resources to feel part of the community, etc. </li>
<li><b>Help them find jobs post-fellowship.</b> Recognize the risk in participating in a one-year fellowship; create resources and a network to help the fellows find jobs after their fellowship. Providing this kind of support system will encourage others to take this risk.</ul>
</ul>


<h4>Team Formation </h4>

<p>CfA seeks a diverse Fellowship class at both the team level (fellows are grouped into teams of three) and within the entire cohort (the entire Fellowship class is approximately 30 fellows). Each team is treated like a very early stage startup in terms of skill needs. We try to make sure each team has development talent (front fnd (JS, CSS, HTML, XML, JQUERY, ETC.), back end (Python, Ruby, JS/Node.js, Java, C#), mobile development database skills (SQL, MongoDB),Heroku, Git, data science), design talent (user experience, graphic design, design thinking, etc.), and people skills (project management, product management, community engagement, content development, and more.)</p>

<p>Within CfA, we work very hard to foster a culture of collaboration within the cohort because no single team of three is guaranteed to have all the skills they need on their own to develop a finished product. </p>

<p>You can also see a breakdown of data on where our total applicants come from and their skills in <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/2013/08/01/2014_fellows_applications/">this blog post</a>. </p>

<h4>Diversity</h4>

<p>Diversity means something different to everyone, but what we mean by diversity when we talk about it in the context of the CfA Fellowship is that we expect the program to respect people from all walks of life, and that the Fellowship class should reflect the diversity of the communities we serve. </p>

<p>We look for a diversity of skillsets and professional backgrounds that match the needs of our projects. We also actively reach out during our Fellows recruitment process to those who are traditionally less prevalent in the tech sector, such as women, racial minorities, and those of diverse sexual orientations, among others. </p>

<p>We at CfA believe that the richer the diversity of a group, the more perspectives available to draw upon. This is very valuable to the work that we do.</p>
