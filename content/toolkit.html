<h1>Fellowship Toolkit </h1>

</p>


<p>Want to start a civic technology innovation program like CfA’s<a href= "http://www.codeforamerica.org/about/fellowship/"> Fellowship </a>program? Then you are in the right place. These are Code for America's tips and best practices for developing an innovation fellowship program. </p>

<h2>Introduction to Code for America's Fellowship Program </h2>

<p>This is Code for America's <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/2011/09/30/were-two/"> backstory</a>, penned by the organization’s founder, Jennifer Pahlka. Code for America’s Fellowship is a year-long public service program where teams of civic-minded developers, designers, and data scientists partner with local governments and use technology and new approaches to better deliver digital services. In the past, teams have worked on improving access to social services, identifying alternatives to incarceration, and civic engagement, among others. You can learn more about past projects <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/apps/">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Starting a Fellowship Program</h2>
<p> After four years of running the program, we have found that there are essential elements that contribute to a successful fellowship program. 
<ol>

<li>A robust developer/ technologist community. Research private sector tech companies or see if there is a <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/">CfA Brigade</a> (CfA’s international citizen volunteer program) group where you live.</li>

<li>Interest from the technology community to dedicate their time for a year of service.</li>

<li>Interest from local government offices in finding technological solutions to service delivery challenges and fostering civic engagement.</li>

<li>Resources, available budget, and flexible procurement policies that allow government agencies to pay for a fellowship program and fellows' stipdends.</li>

<p>If there are governments that don’t have funds but are interested in the program, are there other possible funding sources? Corporate social responsibility programs? Foundations? See this <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/codeforamerica.org/document/d/1Uc8cmQt9-c4DaMD0hvamQwG6cOxNtjFO5Mq6dcdQ9_o/edit#">fundraising resource guide</a> we created for CfA’s Brigades for some ideas.

<p>Please note that the Fellowship program generally requires a hefty time commitment from technologists who sign up as fellows. In our experience, paying fellows is key to fostering commitment and acquiring a large talent pool for recruiting. </p>

</ol>

<p>If you have answered “NO” to any of the questions outlined above, you might want to consider <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/our-work/">other program alternatives</a> before moving forward with a CfA-style fellowship program. Variations of fellowship programs can be found <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/about/international/2013-annual-report/">here</a>.</p>

</p>

These include:

<ul>

<li><b>Preparation</b>: Get government partners ready for the fellowship experience. We hold an onboarding session during the <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/summit/">CfA Summit</a> in the fall, followed by in-city visits. This process includes setting the stage with a broad range of city government staff, aligning community resources, ensuring access to relevant data and setting up logistics like work space, housing, meetings, and access to buildings and IT infrastructure. It also may include some baseline research in areas where we want to have an impact.</li>

<li><b>Fellows Orientation</b>: Prepares fellows for their monthlong residency period in government and for the program overall. This includes an orientation for fellows on <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/our-work/">CfA’s programs</a> and approach, trainings about local government and research methodologies, talks from CfA advisors and mentors, and an opportunity to practice collaborating together to build applications.</li>

<br>

<p class="alert"> This <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/codeforamerica.org/presentation/d/1dgAQNRBBXm6TQMjviU86PLcWcCyOAaN3h5FMl8HvLUg/edit#slide=id.p19">Fellow Curriculum Deep Dive Deck</a> was used during the Fellows’ January Training to prepare them for the curriculum of the first few months of the fellowship. </p>

<li><b>Government Residency (February)</b>: Provides an opportunity for fellows to create relationships with government officials, conduct user research with citizens, develop partnerships with community nonprofits/start-ups, and helps them begin to further scope out the project and start identifying data sets that would be useful for the project. For this phase, fellows live and work in their partner cities. </li>

<li><b>Development Sprints and Mentorship (March–May)</b>: Gives the fellows a chance to build and refine the technology and better scope out the problem they’re trying to solve. When the fellows come back from Residency they begin the development of their first project prototype after whittling their ideas down to a top few. This is when they really start using <a href="http://theleanstartup.com/principles">“lean” principles</a> to build their work. Fellows are also encouraged to use <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/codeforamerica.org/document/d/1ybaIrGcUN3e4uWIHSphlx8UhjSCyr1yfcelg7jZ-Kr8/edit">agile development</a> processes and tests to increase the security and rigor of their app projects. These include unit testing, route testing, and integration testing. The tests functioned as a safeguard against unintentional regressions, and also helped to document the expected behavior of the code in clear, concise code. </li>

<p>Staff engage with fellows at this time with recurring trainings, meetings, and one on one chats to continue supporting fellows. Fellows also meet in person with their government partners and community stakeholders to pitch ideas and get project feedback. </p>

<li><b>Mid-Year Reports and Celebrations (June)</b>: Code for America fellowship teams create a mid-year report on their project progress and metrics. We also host “<a href="http://beta.codeforamerica.org/">BETA</a>”), a small conference that gives the CfA community a chance to learn about what the fellows are working on.</li>

<li><b>Product Sprints and Career Development (July–August)</b>: Fellows continue developing their prototypes and conduct more user research to strengthen their projects. This includes travel as needed to their host cities. CfA staff also support the fellows with connections and ideas about their post-fellowship futures. </li>

<li><b>CfA Summit (September)</b>: The Summit is an annual conference where CfA convenes the global civic tech community. At the Summit, fellows, their government partners, and other civic tech enthusiasts tell their stories to a broader audience. The Summit includes very produced talks that promote the civic tech movement. Check out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLCZV9CR4dQ">app demo</a> from our Louisville Kentucky Team in 2013. We also announce our government city partners for the upcoming year at the Summit, and invite their elected officials and local government staff to attend. This gives our future partners a chance to talk to (and learn from) current government partners about the fellowship experience. </li>

<li><b>Transition and Sustainability (October - November)</b>: CfA fellows and staff work finalize effective sustainability mechanisms to keep the project going for the government partner once the fellowship comes to an end. Staff organizes a celebration for the fellowship class, and begings orienting new government partners for the following year. </li>

</ul>

<h5>The Ideation Process</h5>

</p>



<p>If fellows will work in the same place as their government partners all year long, your calendar may look different. For example, the <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/about/international/2013-annual-report/partners-cfmc.html">Code for Mexico City Fellowship program</a>, organized by <a href="http://labplc.mx/">Mexico City’s Government Innovation Lab</a> had fellows work in the same city as their government partners for the duration of their fellowship. </p>

<ol>

<li><b>Fellowship promotion, application and selection</b>: The Lab promoted its fellowship program in a variety of ways, including the creation of a special promotional video which was disseminated through official government channels. 150 people completed the Lab’s Fellowship application and five were selected.</li>

<li><b>Problem discovery (1 month)</b>: The fellows worked with their government partners to determine the datasets they would need as inputs for their projects and took the necessary steps to make them available. For this stage, the fellows spent some time doing prep work and then two weeks working side by side with their government partners. </li>

<li><b>Minimum Viable Product (2.5 months)</b>: The fellows used the information they gathered during the Discovery phase to develop a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). The MVP was a simple way to explain their idea and to test the viability of their proposed technological solution and collect feedback. </li>

<li><b>Product development (2 months)</b>: Fellows were encouraged to quickly change and refine their product based on  feedback around their MVP. For this portion, the fellows focused their efforts on building out the technical components of their idea and refining the overall graphic design and usability. By the end of this phase, the fellows had created a beta version of their product.</li>

<li><b>Testing (2 months)</b>: The fellows conducted user research to identify bugs and usability issues. They took into account these suggestions and made changes to their applications before handing them off to their government counterparts. </li>

<li><b>App launch and transition to government partners</b>: As the fellowship programs winds down for the year, the fellows work with their government partners to make sure someone from the city is responsible for and equipped to maintain the project. Preparation for this can include technical training for government staff and community organizing with local groups most closely connected to the project. In cities with active CfA Brigade chapters, the members of the local Brigade are key to this transition. Sometimes fellows hold formal launch events for their projects in their cities which is helpful in publicizing the project.</li>

</ol>

<h4>Staffing the Program</h4>

<p>Many staff members work to support the CfA Fellowship program. The main roles and recommended staff profiles are as follows:</p>

<ul>

<li><b>Fellowship Program Director</b>: maintains overall strategy,  and oversees partnerships with other CfA programs and with government city partners. It’s ideal for this person to have a work experience or a background in government.</li>

<li><b>Fellowship Program Manager</b>: responsible for overall delivery, creation, and evaluation of the program. This person should be adept at managing interpersonal relationships, and be detail-oriented and organized.</li>

<li><b>Director of Government Relations</b>: markets the program to local governments, supports program applicants, and assist government partners throughout the fellowship program. It’s helpful for this position to be filled by someone with a sales background, extensive communications skills, and a working knowledge of local government.</li>

<li><b>Senior Manager of City Engagements</b>: collaborates with the Director of Government Relations to develop strong relationships with potential government city partners, understand their needs and support them in applying and executing the Fellowship program. As with the Director of Govt. Relations, it’s helpful for this person to have a strong understanding of local government and have solid interpersonal skills. </li>

<h2>Recruiting Fellows</h2>

<p>Paying fellows sub-market wages makes it difficult to lure candidates away from their high-paying jobs in the tech sector. It is also hard for candidates to voluntarily uproot their lives and relocate to a new city, especially if they have families or community ties. Strong recruitment strategies can help with this.</p>

<h4>Recruitment Strategies</h4>

<p>This <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/codeforamerica.org/presentation/d/1YUEvgW9bWCvbaQjrdo-SNVVRUhzsqtyFJwt9pgrxL5s/edit#slide=id.p14">recruitment deck</a> was used at the Harvard Kennedy School to share how the Fellowship program works and some sample projects that fellows work on. </p>


<ul>
<li>Advertise the program as an opportunity to make a difference and be a part of a bigger network of changemakers. </li>
<li>Highlighting the opportunities for learning during the fellowship is also a very effective approach.</li>
<li>Develop relationships with both national and local press outlets to pitch stories. We create press releases, share stories with local press and/or local leaders who would be willing to share our message. </li>
<li>Collect email addresses and advertise the program through the email. (Code for America currently manages a listserv of over 15,000 civic technologists). </li>
</ul>

(See a sample press release from <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OYHBMkubufM-Y-FSaHNby6WseXfctzuvlzYRz7WH-OA/edit">Code for America’s Fellowship announcement</a>). 

In 2012, <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/codeforamerica.org/file/d/0B0sxopTEkLVNU1pWSU5HZnB1TjQ/edit">this CNN piece</a> interviewing our founder, Jennifer Pahlka, focused on the genesis of the program. In 2014, we collaborated on <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0sxopTEkLVNY1hwZF8tSzdrakU/edit">this smaller piece</a> in FCW News to promote the program to government technology officials who might be eligible to join the Fellowship program. <p>


<p> Here’s an example email we sent to our <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/codeforamerica.org/document/d/1-3POEes1u3aLjKC0xflnd_k-HHnNrlWu53GyP_1pemE/edit">followers on our email list</a>. </p>

<p>If you haven’t already built up a network to help you get the word out, the open source technology community in your area can be a great resource, as can partnering with community organizations (such as churches, libraries or non-profits) and enlisting governments in your area to use their media channels to help you get the word out. </p>

<h4>High-Touch Events and Initiatives</h4>

<ul>

<li><b>Hold events and invite high-profile guests:</b> Host gatherings and events at your offices (or at someone else’s, CfA borrowed many other people’s office spaces before we had our own and often holds events at tech companies’ offices to this day). Most of our mentors are from the government and tech space, and come to our events either as speakers, participants, or in a mentorship capacity. Some of them also serve on our board or on various advisory councils. This took CfA years to build up,  but having endoresements from very respected people in both the tech and government world has been crucial to our recruitment success. </li>

<li><b>Leverage your inner network on social media.</b> High profile mentors and advisors can help you create buzz around your program (a tweet, a post or a phone call on behalf of these figures are all great ways to get the word out). Have them back your cause across many platforms and reach out to their own networks to support of your efforts. </li>

<li><b>Promote your cause at other events.</b> This might mean going to conferences or speaking at events hosted by local tech companies.</li>

</ul>

<p><b>Templates for recruitment </b></p>

<ul>

<li><b><a href="https://docs.google.com/a/codeforamerica.org/document/d/1ptgrXFnF9wrqMhZqSvnvkUhGPWMbCr5oi4JdzYH-pBk/edit">Sample Tweets</b></a>: This document contains sample tweets, job descriptions, and an email signature staff can put in their emails to help recruit people. </li>

<li><b>Facebook Campaign</b>: Use Facebook or a comparable social network to get people interested in the Fellowship. At CfA, we had staff and Fellows post to Facebook/Instagram about “Why They CfA: with an image of them holding up a sign they wrote around our office, and it generated a lot of buzz. </li>

<li><a href="https://vimeo.com/70212611"><b>Code for Mexico City Government Recruitment Video</a></b>: This video was used to get people from Mexico excited about Mexico City government’s first fellowship program.</li>

</ul>

</p>

<p>In addition to getting the word out, a big part of fellowship recruitment is about easing the concern of candidates. The two main concerns we encounter are: 1. I’m scared I won’t be able to find a job post-Fellowship; and 2. I’m worried about relocating. </p>

<p>In response to the first concern we:</p>

<p><b>Offer great networking benefits</b>: CfA provides access to a network of dedicated civic tech professionals and leaders that inspire our work and provide possible career connections for fellows once the program is complete. We work to connect our Fellows with leaders in civic startups, thought leaders like Tim O’Reilly, government leaders (2013 fellow Laura Meixell now <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/codeforamerica.org/file/d/0B0sxopTEkLVNTExPYXFSZmZad1E/edit">works as a data and strategy manager</a> for the government of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) and more. </b>

<p>In response to the second concern we:</p>

<p><b>Provide logistical support</b>: CfA allocates staff time to supporting Fellows’ relocation and pre-orientation. We take care of the small stuff like getting them a public transportation card, giving them suggestions for housing and lists of local resources. </p>

<h4>Team Formation </h4>

<p>CfA seeks a diverse Fellowship class at both the team level (fellows are grouped into teams of three) and within the entire cohort (the entire Fellowship class is approximately 30 fellows). Each team is treated like a very early stage startup in terms of skill needs. We try to make sure each team has development talent (both backend, frontend, database skills, data science), design talent (user experience, graphic design, design thinking, etc.), and people skills (project management, product management, community engagement, content development, and more.)</p>

<p>Within CfA, we work very hard to foster a culture of collaboration within the cohort because no single team of three is guaranteed to have all the skills they need on their own to develop a finished product. </p>

<p>Some examples of the specific skills we look for can be found in <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/codeforamerica.org/presentation/d/1ze5p79dQACvAnsUv5pQakCjIpC8d7oiGWrWWNEp4s-0/edit#slide=id.p16">this deck</a> that we prepared for the Mexico City government when they started a fellowship program. You can also see a breakdown of data on where our total applicants come from and their skills in <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/2013/08/01/2014_fellows_applications/">this blog post</a>. </p>

<h4>Diversity</h4>

<p>Diversity means something different to everyone, but what we mean by diversity when we talk about it in the context of the CfA Fellowship is that we expect the program to respect people from all walks of life, and that the Fellowship class should reflect the diversity of the communities we serve. </p>

<p>We look for a diversity of skillsets and professional backgrounds that match the needs of our projects. We also actively reach out during our Fellows recruitment process to those who are traditionally less prevalent in the tech sector, such as women, racial minorities, and those of diverse sexual orientations, among others. </p>

<p>We at CfA believe that the richer the diversity of a group, the more perspectives available to draw upon. This is very valuable to the work that we do.</p>

<h2> Recruitment and Selection Process of Government Partners</h2>

<p>CfA works to promote the Fellowship program and then receives applications from governments that are interested in participating. Once the application cycle is complete, CfA selects which governments to work with based upon pre-established selection criteria. We try to get a lot of different cities throughout the U.S. interested in the program because we work with multiple cities (between 8 and 10) simultaneously. </p>

<p>We mainly work with local governments at the city and county level because we have found that local governments interact the most with everyday people and we want to help these governments to improve their digital services.</p>

<h4>Laying the Groundwork for Good Government Partners</h4>

<p>Government officials may not be familiar with the working style of Code for America fellows (agile methodologies, etc). Explaining these and things like “emergent outcomes” are important first steps. Another key component is supporting interested government officials in their own work “selling up or selling down,” helping them approach government officials who may be higher or lower in their city’s hierarchy. The fellowship team helps government officials do this mainly by giving them experience and coaching them on sharing how the fellowship can have a positive impact. They provide them with stories, data points, and other information from previous successful projects (such as press clippings, stories about impact). Specifically, they choose a couple of officials within government that can be an internal evangelist of Code for America and the program and give them examples of past CfA projects that are most relevant to their own situation (for example, when CfA was exploring working on education with <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/governments/rhodeisland/">Rhode Island</a>, Luke shared information about CfA’s experience working on similar issues in education with <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/governments/boston/">Boston</a>). These evangelists are critical to making sure that government goes through with the application process. </p>

<p>After developing these internal champions (which is an overall process of 50% salesmanship and 50% coaching), the Fellowship team coaches the cities in getting someone in a senior role into discussions about bringing the fellowship to that city. This usually begins as a phone conversation with both the internal evangelists and the senior person on their team on the line. From that conversation CfA helps flesh out that team’s motivations and blockers so that we can help them navigate the application process and how to get the project funded. </p>

<h4>Spreading the Word</h4>

<p>We have two main government partner outreach strategies:</p>

<p><b>Broad</p></b>

<p>To get a lot of governments interested in applying for the program, CfA:</p>

<ul>

<li>publicizes the opening of the application process on our website, through our network of government officials (mailing lists, forums, etc.), and on our other networks (see Fellows recruitment section)</li>

<li>leverages strategic connections to help market the Fellowship for us. We suggest that you look at your funders, your former government partners, your Board, your advisors, etc., and ask them to use their relationships and authority to get government partners interested. </li>

<li>partners with other organizations that help us build credibility. In the US, we work closely with the US Conference of Mayors and the Harvard Kennedy School. We recommend that you build relationships with organizations by offering to be a resource and by positioning your org. as a subject matter expert. These groups will then call on you and engage you in speaking opportunities.</li>

<li>tells stories. We talk about stories that resonate with potential government partners. We get good publicity from success stories from past projects and widely share them.</p></li>

</ul>

<b><p>Targeted </p></b>

<p>The most effective way we’ve found to to get governments interested in participating in the Fellowship program is to contact them directly. This can be hard if you don’t have a direct connection so you may need to cold call or rely on those in your network to make an intro. Make a pipeline, prioritize and then execute against your outreach plan (calls, emails, etc).

<p>A big part of this strategy for getting governments interested in the Fellowship program revolves around understanding the needs of governments in the U.S. and tailoring our discussion of the Fellowship program to fit their needs. This has the dual effect of increasing the number of government applicants while simultaneously fostering dialogue around the role of technology in improving government at the local level.</p>

<p>Once we have set the stage by publicizing the program among a large audience of potential government partners, we begin a process of even more focused outreach. Think of it as dating between CfA Staff and Government Partners. </p>

<h4>High Level Government Officials</h4>

<p>It is important to partner with mayors and other high-level government officials early on because they can connect and influence other government departments who might be interested in collaborating with the fellows. Mayors in the U.S. generally understand what’s happening at the ground level in their governments and have the political capital to get others signed on. </p>

<p>It is ideal to approach mayors shortly after an election. In our experience, mayors get excited about the program because they want innovation in their governments, and to be known as trying to “do things differently” with a new policy agenda. They oftentimes hope to use that to carry momentum for their term. Creating positive public relations opportunities such as photo-ops and media attention are helpful in working with mayors and other high level government officials. <p/>

<p>Established tech executives in your community can be helpful in facilitating introductions to these officials (just getting your foot in the door to pitch to an official at that level can be hard). In CfA’s earlier years, we relied heavily on our Board member’s networks. Today, government officials who have participated in the program are extremely useful in getting others on board. On a case-by-case basis, CfA can help to facilitate introductions between mayors in other countries and those in the U.S. who can attest to the value of participating in the Fellowship program. </p>

<p>Here are some general tips for pitching the Fellowship program to high level government officials:</p>

<ul>

<li>Identify their biggest challenges to governing and suggest different ways that technology could help solve them.

Highlight potential for positive publicity from participating in the program.</li>

<li>Articulate the program as a way to help them achieve high-level goals and objectives. Find a specific official who’s responsible for a certain goal and explain how the fellowship could help them meet that goal.</li>

<li>Frame the Fellowship as a way inspire a culture of innovation that can sweep through their local government.</li>

<li>Emphasize opportunities to increase efficiency, lower costs, enhance civic engagement and foster innovation.</li>

<li>Share examples of success stories, either from your own work or from similar initiatives. You can find a list of examples of "wins" from CfA programs <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/codeforamerica.org/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ah1olKDkcI9WdE1MVHl5ZGQ5LS1TZzRiQjU3Q2ZfX0E&usp=drive_web#gid=1">here</a> and videos showcasing apps and stories from past CfA projects <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/apps/">here.</a></li>

<li>Invite them to a fun event where the energy will get them psyched. Often, asking them to speak is a way to get an official at an event they wouldn’t usually go to.</li>

</ul>

<p>As Luke explains:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“It's about identifying the goals and outcomes for their government. Often I encourage government partners to express problems that citizens encounter. I tell them I want them to do some fact-finding to ensure we know there is an issue and where those issues are. I explain that they can use data to pinpoint areas of opportunities, and then nudge them to identify the goals and outcomes they hope to see through the program.”</p>

</blockquote>

<h4>Government Officials in Middle Management</h4>

<h6>(typically from the government IT Department, like an IT Manager, or from the larger government bureaucracy, like a Policy Manager) </h6>

<p>Middle managers are crucial to government programs. In our experience it’s sometimes hard for them to envision how the Fellowship could be useful for their work. These officials have frequently been charged with safekeeping data and preserving processes which can seem in direct contrast with the Fellowship program. Generally, staff from the government IT department are resource-constrained so they initially see the only value in collaborating with the Fellowship program being an opportunity for their team to contribute to executing something specific and meaningful. The emphasis on cultivating and nurturing “emergent outcomes” that comes out of the Fellowship program is difficult to sell to this constituency. Many times higher level officials have been helpful to us in getting mid-level managers on board.</p>

<p>Here are some tips for pitching the Fellowship program to middle-management government officials (a lot of these strategies are helpful for more senior government officials too):</p>

<ul>

<li>Give them a lot of information and concrete examples from past Fellowship programs. You can find examples of successes in this government <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/codeforamerica.org/document/d/1YiVsG_l7DXGvwnAq_kPjxnR3HmTvLz_N6wxsigF0SLY/edit">Guide on the Fellowship</a>, which is a handbook we prepare and distribute to government partners (present and potential). </li>

<li>Go over some of the datasets that they already have in-house and explain how those data sets could be made useful. Focus on “non-controversial” datasets first. For example, if they have a dataset that lists all of the times and dates that garbage is picked up, explain how that dataset could be used as an input to an SMS application that can remind residents to take out their trash on that day. If you have the resources, it’s even better to show these “quick-wins” and build something simple that will give officials a clear picture of what can be accomplished. </li>

<li>Focus your efforts on approaching top managers within these departments who have decision-making power.</li>

<li>Try to get to know officials on a personal level and better understand the constraints facing their department, what they’re passionate about and what issues they’d like to work on. Find examples of civic tech innovations that could address those issues or brainstorm ideas for future projects that could be effective at leveraging technology to solve their problem.</li>

<li>Target outreach efforts to Innovation Officers, Chief Data Officers, and Chief Digital Officers (or their equivalent) if these positions exist in the government you’re interested in working with. People with these roles can be very effective allies.</li>

<li>Build a relationship with local citizen engagement and civic technology groups (if they exist), like a <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/">Brigade</a> in your community. They can connect you with officials.</li>

</ul>

<p>When you approach people in government about the Fellowship program, it’s important to be mindful of the language you use. If you have a technology background, don’t make any assumptions about a government official’s degree of technical expertise. Avoid using terms such as “open source, GitHub issues, API, prototyping, agile development” and other “jargon” unless you take the time to explain the meaning. These terms are commonplace in the technology world but are mostly foreign to government workers. Using tech-heavy terminology can be isolating, patronizing and, most importantly, derail the potential for collaboration. </p>

<p>Framing is also key. In CfA’s early days we made the mistake of presenting the program as CfA fellows “fixing government.” The Fellowship program should always be presented as a partnership between two groups that are passionate about public service and want to make a difference in their communities. The emphasis on collaboration and participatory processes should be established at the very beginning. Resources from our Brigade toolkit on <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/codeforamerica.org/document/d/1WtoE_Kfqcu73MCUOIXujrzTfqrQAW3DGt0sC8iKJ6Rw/edit#heading=h.z53m2pux0tw5">how to collaborate with government</a> may also be useful to you in your efforts to pitch the program to potential government partners. </p>

<h4>Approaching Potential Partners</h4>

<p>The road to contracting with government partners differs a lot with each potential partner. When CfA first started out, we used personal networks, our Board, and publicity from speaking at events like government conferences to drum up interest in our programs. Now that we have a reputation for the work we’ve done, things play out a bit differently. Here are some examples to give you an idea of how we form partnerships with government partners.</p>

<ul>

<li>Somerville approached us to get involved in Code for America’s <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/our-work/initiatives/digitalfrontdoor/">Digital Front Door</a> project. Code for America couldn’t work with them on that project, but we identified that Somerville officials wanted access to new tech and new ways of doing things. Our Fellowship team helped them understand how the Fellowship could support them in accomplishing their goals. They’re currently one of our <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/governments/2015-cities/">2015 Fellowship cities</a>.</li>

<li>In Indianapolis, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana (a previous Code for America partner) sent a letter to the mayor of Indianapolis recommending that the city work with Code for America. This opened up a conversation with the mayor of Indianapolis about how partnering with CfA could help make progress towards goals they had for improving public safety in the city. This is an example of how government officials you’ve worked with in the past can be important advocates by introducing you to people in their network and by speaking on your behalf.</li>

<li>In Richmond, VA’s case, the government officials there had applied previously for CfA’s Fellowship program but weren’t selected because there wasn’t a clear and specifically scoped out problem that the Fellowship program could help to solve. The Fellowship team kept Richmond engaged with Code for America through the <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/about/peernetwork/">Peer Network</a> (our network of government officials who receive trainings through webinars and connect to each other about how to use technology to better solve civic issues). They also kept in touch with government contacts in Richmond, educating them about our model, and working to better understand their thinking about the impact they want to make using technology. It was a long process of building the relationship and scoping out a possible project. We were eventually able to figure out a place where their needs overlapped with what the Fellowship program could offer and Richmond is a 2015 Fellowship city.</li>

</ul>

<h4>Application Flow</h4>

<p>Code for America aims to both have the best applications, and as many as possible. We encourage many cities to apply even if funding is unclear, as we can help them figure that out later on in the process. Also, many first time applicants become cities in future rounds if they don’t make it the first time. In terms of communications, between Jan and March 31s we expect to have approximately 7-12 communications with the cities who are going through the application process, 3-4 times a month.</p>

<h4>Selection Criteria</h4>

<p>We use the following criteria to determine which cities applying to the Fellowship program we should work with:</p>

<ul>

<li>strong leadership and buy-in for the program</li>

<li>internal sponsorship by key players in and outside of the department Code for America fellows would partner with

a potential for impact and general project scope that aligns with Code for America’s <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/our-work/focus-areas/">focus areas</a></li>

<li>confirmed or promised budget (these normally include prospective matching funds) </li>

<li>a clear understanding of CfA’s approach</li>

demonstrated interest in improving digital services in tangible ways (evidence we can actually see)

<h2>Addressing Government Concerns</h2>

<p>Over the years we’ve found that there are certain concerns that government officials commonly have. We’ve outlined the most common ones below and offered some approaches for how to dissuade these concerns. </p>

<h4>Money $ - How will I raise my half?</h4>

<p>Government partners are responsible for contributing $220K towards the total CfA Fellowship program cost of $440K. This is a LOT of money for local governments and when they hear this some start to feel “sticker shock.” Your own fellowship programs will likely have different costs. </p>

<p>Some of you may not charge your government partners, have partial match funding from foundations or other philanthropic organizations or perhaps your Fellows are on leave from their high-paid technology jobs and their company is footing most of the bill as part of a corporate social responsibility program. You can read more about an alternative funding models <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/media/docs/codeforall/cftc-casestudy.pdf">here</a>. But, for those groups who need their government partner to contribute, money (or a lack there of) can be a serious barrier to participation. </p>

<p>When we go over the costs with our government partners, we first make sure that they understand that they are not expected to pay for the whole program. Instead, they are paying $220K but receiving a program valued at $440K (CfA makes up the rest through a variety of fundraising mechanisms). It is a 50/50 match program between CfA and the government partner. </p>

<p>Some strategies we use for addressing this concern:</p>

<ul>

<li>Acknowledge the validity of their fear and concern</li>

<li>Be empathetic to their situation</li>

<li>Emphasize the 50/50 split between them and CfA </li>

<li>Highlight opportunities for local fundraising to cover their share of the costs of the Fellowship and outline the ways CfA can support them in fundraising</li>

<li>Focus on the program’s potential to have a positive impact and explain how the program aims to ultimately save them money. Give examples!</li>

<li>Discuss how much unnecessary money large-scale technology investments tend to cost governments without working well. Emphasize the service value and cost-savings from innovation culture, the use of lightweight technologies, and lean processes. </li>

</ul>

<p class="alert">Some variations of the CfA Fellowship program have covered all of the costs of the Fellowship program. For example, the Code for the Caribbean program chose not to charge their first government partner for the cost of the program. They did this because it was more important to them to pilot the initiative in the Caribbean and have a tangible example to point to for future potential partners than to receive funding. Even though the <a href="http://www.codeforthecaribbean.org/">Code for the Caribbean</a> team’s government partner did not contribute financially, the government agency was still very invested in the program. In CfA’s experience, financial investment from our government partners appears to heighten commitment to the program and, thus, programmatic success. But, as the experience of Code for the Caribbean shows, this likely depends a lot on your own context and goals. Understand that there are benefits and challenges that come along with where your funding is from to make the decision that’s best for your context.</p>

<h4>Resource Constraints</h4>

<h5?How can I justify spending money on the Fellowship instead of other things?</h5>

<p>Lots of local governments are worried that they don’t have enough resources to partner with the Fellowship program. They’re oftentimes concerned that this is not a useful allocation of their (limited) resources. </p>

<p>Some strategies for addressing this concern:</p>

<ul>

<li>Listen to and try to understand their concerns. Knowing what resources they do have will be important in working with them to find a way forward. </li>

<li>Help them see how doing things differently could save them money in the long-term. Do they agree that there are technology problems? That the tech they have isn’t working as well as they like or that they’re paying too much money for clunky systems? Do they have have a sense, real or perceived, that there is a better way of doing things? That they are doing things in ways that are maybe less efficient than they’d like, that don’t take advantage of modern web tools? Tease out these problems and explain how the Fellowship could help them to solve these problems. </li>

<li>Explain that the Fellowship is a proven model. The Fellowship has produced projects that have concretely helped government agencies deliver their services better, and/or delivered government partners lean, iterative, user-centered processes to start delivering better digital services themselves. The Fellowship gives talented people free space to come in and execute in environments typically mired in bureaucracy, but also empower others in the government to do the same. Emphasize this in response to expressed concerns.</li>

<li>Reframe their objections. Brainstorm with the potential government partner about how the Fellowship can help them overcome some of the challenges that are behind their objections. Give them ideas about re-allocating resources and emphasize that the Fellowship is about more than just creating an application - that the experience itself is a full service in growing capabilities around delivering user-centered digital services.</li>

<h5>Why won’t the Fellows live in my community full-time?</h5>

<p>Government officials are oftentimes worried that the fellows won’t be in their city full time. This may or may not be the case for your situation. Many other groups who have run a Fellowship have had fellows live in the same city as their government partner. This is typically a concern for government officials who face pressure to keep job opportunities local, prompting officials to anticipate their constituents asking the question “why don’t we hire people from our own backyard?”</p>

<p>Some strategies for addressing this concern:</p>

<ul>

<li>Be very explicit about the residency period of the fellowship and what it entails. Frame residency as an important opportunity for in-depth engagement with the government partner that is not distracted by common day-to-day life stuff that someone local would likely need to tend to.</li>

<li>Stress the value of the Fellows having a fresh perspective on the government and the challenges they are addressing.

Point to the success of CfA’s program in other places using this model.</li>

<li>Ask the official to reflect upon things that are sometimes difficult to get done as a full-time staff member and emphasize the value of having outside people come in who are somewhat autonomous from the rest of the agency. </li>

<li>Offer that fellows make more than the average 4 visits to their Fellowship cities. Keep in mind that you’ll need, additional resources to cover these travel costs.</li>

</ul>

<p>If this issue is a dealbreaker for your government partner, it is also worth exploring alternative models. One option is to offer for the fellows to live there full time. For more information on such models, please see <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/about/international/2013-annual-report/">here</a>.</p>

<h5>How do I know the fellows will do a good job?</h5>

<p>This is a very understandable concern. Government partners need to justify spending scarce resources on the program. At CfA, we are fortunate to be able to point to a track record of successes with previous Fellowship programs and also have the benefit of a very competitive application pool. Your own ability to successfully dissuade this concern will be tied in large part to your success recruiting quality Fellows. If you are able to recruit Fellows with impressive CVs and experiences you can point to them to ease these concerns. It’s a lot more challenging to make this assurance without already having Fellows on board. </p>

<p>Some strategies for addressing this concern:</p>

<ul>

<li><b>(Again) BE EMPATHETIC. </b> A surefire way to stop a government official from partnering with you is to dismiss their issues. We start off by outlining their concerns (and truly work to do so) and then emphasize why this model works.</li>

<li>Talk about your recruitment and application process. We emphasize that our application is extremely competitive and stress that the acceptance rate to be part of a CfA Fellowship class is lower than Harvard’s.</li>

<li>Outline the positive qualities of the Fellows. We at CfA explain that they are professional level, that their average age is 30, and that the majority have 5-10 years of professional work experience. We also stress that the background they have in cutting-edge technology complements more traditional government experience.</li>

<h5>But I need a specific problem solved! What are emergent outcomes, anyway? </h5>

<p>The idea that the Fellows wouldn’t necessarily work on a specific problem is understandably difficult to grasp for government partners who face strict budgets. At CfA, we work very closely with government partners to understand needs around specific problems ahead of time. We work to carefully balance these desires with clear messaging around the importance of creating space for other outcomes to emerge.</p>

<p>Some strategies for addressing this concern:</p>

<ul>

<li>Outline what’s broken with the current way that governments build digital services. Point to contextualized examples (in the U.S. speaking about the failure of healthcare.gov is really effective, in the U.K. it’s great to talk about the impact of Government Digital Services and how it transformed their national government). </li>

<li>(Again) Be empathetic. A surefire way to turn off a government official from partnering with you is to dismiss their concerns. Start off by outlining that you understand their concerns (and truly work to do so) and then emphasize why this model works. </li>

<li>Explain that emergent outcomes are the product of “agile and lean processes” which have to do with learning from citizens about their problems and then changing and improving the solution as we learn, quickly. Emphasize that top start-up businesses use these tactics because they work. Use clear and non-technical language to explain this. </li>

<li>Tell lots of stories that show the value of emergent outcomes. Pointing to real-world situations is especially helpful.

One example from CfA’s experience was when the CfA Fellows worked with the City of Boston on their public education program in 2011. Originally, the government partners were concerned that they didn’t have enough data about students in Boston’s public schools to drive policy decisions. They wanted the fellows to construct a way to capture student data more easily and make it accessible through an API. The Fellows started to talk to the community (conducting “user research”) and a different problem “emerged.” Parents were struggling to navigate the system for choosing their kids’ public schools. The Fellows figured this out and built a website to supercede the really complicated and confusing PDF document that parents had been using for 55 years to choose a school. In this way, the Fellows were still able to help the government toward the goal of using technology to improve education but the outcome was different and much more powerful, important and relevant to the community. The “emergent outcome” process made this better outcome possible. </li>

<li>Work closely with the government partner to learn as much as possible about the problem they’re facing ahead of time. Scope this out with them and explain how the Fellows will take this into account when doing research for their project.</li>

<li>On a case by case basis CfA can connect potential government partners to other governments who can attest to the value of this approach and can chat about emergent outcomes in more detail.</li>

<h5>What happens when the Fellows leave?</h5>

<p>Fellows come in to a government, they build something, but then they leave. The government world is littered with failed technology projects because companies time and time again have done just that and government staff aren’t equipped to pick up the pieces to keep things running. This makes government officials understandably cautious about “hiring” outside people to build something for them instead of doing it in-house. It also makes them worried about the program’s end date.</p>

<p>Most government agencies, however, aren’t set up to create the same types of projects that the Fellowship program produces. When addressing concerns around the sustainability of a project and handover to government partners it’s important to set the Fellowship program and its offerings apart from the typical “waterfall” style IT project.</p>

<p>Some strategies for addressing this concern:</p>

<ul>

<li>Adopt an empathetic point of view and explain that this is a great question, one your team is continually focused on and cares deeply about.</li>

<li>Emphasize how the Fellowship program is different from traditional IT contracts they may have faced in the past (agile processes, emergent outcomes, etc.). Explain why this is a good thing. </li>

<li>Focus on the culture change that occurs within governments as a result of participation in the fellowship program. Point to proven examples of culture changes that contribute to sustaining Fellowship projects and the “innovation virus” once the Fellowship is technically over. </li>

<li>Explain that fellows are trained to develop an application and have it completed by September or October (2 months before the end of CfA’s Fellowship program) to allow time for them to work with their government government teams to transition it to their partner.</li>

<li>Tell government partners about the role the community can have in sustaining the project. For example, many of the CfA <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/">Brigades </a> work with their governments to collaborate on strategic and high impact tech projects. Encourage government partners to think through the resources they have at their disposal, not only within government but also in their community, who could contribute to maintaining the project once the Fellows leave. Keep in mind that some governments have very active hacker communities and civic tech enthusiasts who could be engaged (in places where this is not the case, this strategy isn’t the best fit). If this is the case, it’s highly advisable to get these groups involved from the start of the project (which CfA, for example, makes an effort to do through our Brigade program). </li>

<li>Highlight the continual skill share, learning exchange and capacity-building that occurs throughout the Fellowship. Outline how participating in the Fellowship program will give the government partner’s staff the skills to make sustainability much easier. </li>

</ul>

<h2>Engaging with Government and Community Partners</h2>

<h4>Laying the Groundwork for Successful Projects </h4>

<p>Before the project begins (and oftentimes even before the city applies for the program), no decisions are made about the exact technology that will be used and/or developed for the project. Instead, we try to identify initial technological issues, skill gaps (things we think government workers will need to know to effectively deliver a digital service and understand what work has been done so far on open data and other areas that could be relevant to the program (google analytics, user research, etc.). Scoping the problem takes a lot of time. Before the start of the Fellowship, our Fellowship team does not do direct research in the cities with local communities, but they do work to flesh out the goals, outcomes and general impact the city is looking for. They help the potential government partners to think through a variety of possible projects that are not too big and not too small. Governments are used to the “waterfall” approach of procuring technology. For this, they have to figure out exactly what they want to buy ahead of time. The Fellowship staff often need to steer cities towards focusing on goals and impacts instead of on the details of the application itself. </p>

<h4>Setting Up A Successful Government Partner Team</h4>

<p>CfA works to establish a strong leadership team in the city government to support fellows. The criteria for this strong leadership team is that they have internal influence, subject matter expertise, and are trained in what the fellowship process will be like. This helps there to be a clear understanding at all levels about how the fellowship works. It’s important to remove perceived and/or structural blockers to people’s support or involvement in the program. In our experience, most partners have been subject matter experts rather than part of a city’s central leadership. Sometimes in this type of partnership structure we’ve encountered challenges with the IT team. Going forward, Code for America is focusing on cross-functional team alignment. Above all, leadership is key to support the fellowship work.</p>

<h4>Engaging with non-government partners</h4>

<p>A third thing that’s really important to consider when scoping out and running the Fellowship program is the role non-government groups can have in complementing the program. <p>

<p>The level of engagement of partners like foundations, nonprofits, corporate sponsors, etc. in fellowship cities varies a lot. It’s advisable to involve these groups in conversations with the city early on, not just about fundraising for the program, but also about the project itself. Many of these groups will have a lot of subject-matter expertise and deep roots in the community. They’ll likely be knowledgeable about community issues and be able to help the fellows connect with diverse groups for the discovery phase of the program and for ongoing user research. The involvement of non-government partners should be carefully managed to strike a balance between giving the fellows an appropriate amount of autonomy by ensuring partners don’t impose their own agenda but also cultivating a healthy collaboration between the two. It’s important to reinforce a focus on the citizen and government’s role in providing for citizens, not on any one partner’s agenda. CfA works directly with non-government partners before the Fellowship program officially begins to scope out the different partner’s roles and responsibilities within the project and to manage expectations. The nature of these partnerships will usually evolve over time and consistent communication will be important to maintain a positive working relationship between these community partners, the Fellows and the government partners. </p>

<h2>Preparing Government Partners for the Program</h2>

<p>Once you’ve addressed your government partner’s concerns and gotten them on board to participate in the Fellowship program, it’s important to get everyone on the same page and set the stage for the Fellowship program to be a success. Setting up the right team support structure within government for the fellows, fostering continued government engagement, and encouraging ongoing participation are all crucial for this piece. </p>

<h4>CfA’s prep work for governments partners selected for the Fellowship program includes: </h4>

<ul>

<li>Periodic emails with relevant information</li>

<li>Creation of a government google group as forum for Q&A</li>

<li>Formal orientation webinar (one per city)</li>

<li>Fellowship Guidebook</li>

<li>Conference call with government staff to discuss program scope</li>

<li>Pre-CfA-Summit On-boarding Session</li>

<li>Summit Sessions</li>

<li>Presentation of CfA info to government officials as necessary on an ongoing basis</li>

<li>Site visit of CfA staff to partner city</li>

</ul>

<h4>Things to keep in mind during prep work:</h4>

<ul>

<li>Generate enthusiasm and excitement for the program</li>

<li>Orient governments on program details</li>

<li>Create a useful forum for Q&A, comments and feedback</li>

<li>Set expectations of CfA participation experience</li>

<li>Support government partners in gaining broader support for CfA in their governments</li>

<li>Create a unified understanding of government problem areas and areas of focus</li>

<li>Involve other community groups who exercise local leadership and have subject matter expertise from the community</li>

</ul>

<h3>Government On-Boarding Session and Summit Sessions</h3>

<p>Before the official start of the Fellowship program, government officials receive a half day on-boarding session right before the CfA Summit (which normally takes place in late September, 3 months before the Fellowship program officially starts). This helps ground them in their goals, orient them around the program, and connect them with each other.

An example agenda can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/codeforamerica.org/document/d/1M6Q6987lmtqWN-Vb0ApqVUoAFEiC7hdJhBjVY7qgcvE/edit">here</a>. </p>

<p>The Summit itself (which is usually 2.5 days) is used as a training mechanism to help increase government officials’ knowledge about a variety of topics and to excite them about what’s possible using civic technology. It is not focused necessarily on helping them build skills, although that is something that we’re starting to work more intentionally on developing for the future. CfA staff points government partners towards sessions we think will be most helpful in preparing them for the Fellowship program. An example from 2014 of those suggested summit sessions can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/codeforamerica.org/document/d/1Kwd6ykqyS6yKYgyrGsRFJqtNa7vbBGlYNELuLYSjCrs/edit">here</a>.</p>

<p>CfA staff also visit government officials in their city a few weeks before the Fellowship program begins to do planning, goal alignment, and help ensure the right systems are in place before the start of the Fellowship program. </p>

<p>Throughout the program, CfA staff provide hours of ad-hoc support, meet with government partners to make sure we’re aligned around goals, and engage in conversations about the data and tech that’s available in the city. </p>

<p>CfA staff are consistently available to help our government partners overcome obstacles, get others excited about the program, and give advice about how to more productively engage with fellows. Overall, once the program begins, we heavily rely on the fellows to push the project forward. In the future, Code for America is looking at ways to more concretely support cities throughout the program in the form of trainings and more targeted engagement during the course of the Fellowship program.</p>
