            <h4>About</h4>

            <p><a href="https://civicentrepreneurship.eventbrite.com">Code for America is hosting evening panel discussions with leaders in the civic technology field about opportunities for civic technology startups.</a>

	</br>
	 </br>

Civic technology is a rapidly growing sector that holds huge potential for a new generation of startups. A recent Knight Foundation report on civic technology noted that the sector saw $430 million in investment in just the last two years. It's not only a new market ripe with opportunity it's essential to our democracy. Government needs new options -- options of modern, high quality tools and services that are offered at reasonable rates.

 </br>
 </br>


Civic technology is technology that’s spurring civic engagement, enhancing citizen communications, improving government infrastructure, or generally making government more effective.
 </br>
 </br>

This event is hosted by Code for America's Civic Accelerator, which provides civic startups with funding, mentorship, and the right connections to navigate the government technology ecosystem.
 </br>
 </br>

The panel discussions will be followed by a reception with snacks and beverages.
