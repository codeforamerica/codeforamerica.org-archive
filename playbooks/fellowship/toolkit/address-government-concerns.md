Over the years, we’ve found that government officials share some common concerns around participating in the Code for America Fellowship program. We’ve outlined the most common ones below and offered some approaches for how to dissuade these issues.

## Fundraising concerns

Your own fellowship programs will likely have different costs, but the Code for America Fellowship program costs $440,000. This is a lot of money for local governments and when they hear this some start to feel “sticker shock.” 

When we go over the costs with our government partners, we first make sure that they understand that they are not expected to pay for the whole program. Instead, they are paying $220K but receiving a program valued at $440K (CfA makes up the rest through a variety of fundraising mechanisms). It is a 50/50 match program between CfA and the government partner. 

Some of you may not charge your government partners, have partial match funding from foundations or other philanthropic organizations or perhaps your Fellows are on leave from their high-paid technology jobs and their company is footing most of the bill as part of a corporate social responsibility program. But, for those groups who need their government partner to contribute, money (or a lack there of) can be a serious barrier to participation. Some strategies we use for addressing this concern include:

 - Acknowledge the validity of their fear and concern
 - Be empathetic to their situation
 - Emphasize the 50/50 split between them and CfA 
 - Highlight opportunities for local fundraising to cover their share of the costs of the Fellowship and outline the ways CfA can support them in fundraising
 - Focus on the program’s potential to have a positive impact and explain how the program aims to ultimately save them money. Give examples!
 - Discuss how much unnecessary money large-scale technology investments tend to cost governments without working well. Emphasize the service value and cost-savings from innovation culture, the use of lightweight technologies, and lean processes. 

Another idea is to consider alternative models. For example, the [Code for the Caribbean](http://www.codeforthecaribbean.org/) program chose not to charge their first government partner for the cost of the program. They did this because it was more important to them to pilot the initiative in the Caribbean and have a tangible example to point to for future potential partners than to receive funding. Even though the team’s government partner did not contribute financially, the government agency was still very invested in the program. In CfA’s experience, financial investment from our government partners appears to heighten commitment to the program and, thus, programmatic success. But, as the experience of Code for the Caribbean shows, this likely depends a lot on your own context and goals. Understand that there are benefits and challenges that come along with where your funding is from to make the decision that’s best for your context.


## Paying for fellows to mostly live/work in San Francisco

Government officials are oftentimes worried that the fellows won’t be in their city full time. This may or may not be the case for your situation. Many other groups who have run a Fellowship have had fellows live in the same city as their government partner. This is typically a concern for government officials who face pressure to keep job opportunities local, prompting officials to anticipate their constituents asking the question “why don’t we hire people from our own backyard?” To answer this question, we usually:

### Explain residency period of the fellowship and what it entails

Frame residency as an important opportunity for in-depth engagement with the government partner that is not distracted by common day-to-day life stuff that someone local would likely need to tend to.

### Offer that fellows make more than the average 4 visits to their fellowship cities.

Keep in mind that you’ll need additional resources to cover these travel costs.

### Stress value

Fellows will bring a fresh perspective on the government and the challenges they are addressing.

## Knowing if the program is "worth it"

This is a very understandable concern. Government partners need to justify spending scarce resources on the program. At CfA, we are fortunate to be able to point to a track record of successes with previous fellowship programs and also have the benefit of a very competitive application pool. Your own ability to successfully dissuade this concern will be tied in large part to your success recruiting quality fellows. If you are able to recruit fellows with impressive CVs and experiences you can point to them to ease these concerns. It’s a lot more challenging to make this assurance without already having Fellows on board. We suggest you:

### Talk about your recruitment and application process.

We emphasize that our application is extremely competitive and stress that the acceptance rate to be part of a CfA fellowship class is lower than Harvard University’s.

### Outline the positive qualities of the Fellows

We at CfA explain that they are professional level, that their average age is 30, and that the majority have 5-10 years of professional work experience. We also stress that the background they have in cutting-edge technology complements more traditional government experience.

### Explain that the fellowship is a proven model.

The fellowship has produced projects that have concretely helped government agencies deliver their services better, and/or delivered government partners lean, iterative, user-centered processes to start delivering better digital services themselves. The Fellowship gives talented people free space to come in and execute in environments typically mired in bureaucracy, but also empower others in the government to do the same. Emphasize this in response to expressed concerns.

## Having a specific problem and ignoring "emergent outcomes"

The idea that the fellows wouldn’t necessarily work on a specific problem is understandably difficult to grasp for government partners who face strict budgets. At CfA, we work very closely with government partners to understand needs around specific problems ahead of time. We work to carefully balance these desires with clear messaging around the importance of creating space for other outcomes to emerge. Some helpful tips include:

### Outline what’s broken with the current way that governments build digital services.

Point to contextualized examples (in the U.S. speaking about the failure of healthcare.gov is really effective, in the U.K. it’s great to talk about the impact of Government Digital Services and how it transformed their national government).

### Be empathetic

Do not dismiss a partner government's concerns. Start off by outlining that you understand their concerns (and truly work to do so) and then emphasize why this model works.

### Highlight the benefits of an iterative work process

Explain how learning from citizens about their problems and then changing and improving the solution as we learn, quickly. Emphasize that top start-up businesses use these tactics because they work. Use clear and non-technical language to explain this. 

### Show the value of emergent outcomes

Pointing to real-world situations is especially helpful.

One example from CfA’s experience was when the CfA Fellows worked with the City of Boston on their public education program in 2011. Originally, the government partners were concerned that they didn’t have enough data about students in Boston’s public schools to drive policy decisions. They wanted the fellows to construct a way to capture student data more easily and make it accessible through an API. The Fellows started to talk to the community (conducting “user research”) and a different problem “emerged.” Parents were struggling to navigate the system for choosing their kids’ public schools. The Fellows figured this out and built a website to supercede the really complicated and confusing PDF document that parents had been using for 55 years to choose a school. In this way, the Fellows were still able to help the government toward the goal of using technology to improve education but the outcome was different and much more powerful, important and relevant to the community. The “emergent outcome” process made this better outcome possible. </li>

### Learn about the problem

Scope this out with them and explain how the Fellows will take this into account when doing research for their project.

## Project Sustainability Concerns

Fellows come in to a government, they build something, but then they leave. The government world is littered with failed technology projects because companies time and time again have done just that and government staff aren’t equipped to pick up the pieces to keep things running. This makes government officials understandably cautious about “hiring” outside people to build something for them instead of doing it in-house. It also makes them worried about the program’s end date.

Most government agencies, however, aren’t set up to create the same types of projects that the Fellowship program produces. When addressing concerns around the sustainability of a project and handover to government partners it’s important to set the Fellowship program and its offerings apart from the typical “waterfall” style IT project. We suggest:


### The difference from traditional IT contracts

Highlight the benefits of agile processes, emergent outcomes, and user research. Explain why this is a good thing.

### Focus on culture change

Point to proven examples of culture changes that contribute to sustaining Fellowship projects and the “innovation virus” once the Fellowship is technically over.

### Explain the process 

Describe how fellows are trained to develop an application and have it completed by September or October (2 months before the end of CfA’s Fellowship program) to allow time for them to work with their government government teams to transition it to their partner.

### Explain how the community can help with sustainability 

For example, many of the CfA <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/">Brigades </a> work with their governments to collaborate on strategic and high impact tech projects. Encourage government partners to think through the resources they have at their disposal, not only within government but also in their community, who could contribute to maintaining the project once the Fellows leave. Keep in mind that some governments have very active hacker communities and civic tech enthusiasts who could be engaged (in places where this is not the case, this strategy isn’t the best fit). If this is the case, it’s highly advisable to get these groups involved from the start of the project (which CfA, for example, makes an effort to do through our Brigade program).

### Highlight continual improvement

Highlight the continual skill share, learning exchange and capacity-building that occurs throughout the Fellowship. Outline how participating in the fellowship program will give the government partner’s staff the skills to make sustainability much easier.
