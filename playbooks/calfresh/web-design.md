##Purpose 
For many- enrolling for CalFresh begins online through a search engine. We have found that in California each month, there are about 100,000 searches for information about food stamps. They include terms like "calfresh", "cal fresh", "cal fresh eligibility", and "apply for food stamps". 

These searches likely represent Californians who are aware of the program and are searching for more information about how to apply. However, for both generic and city/county specific search terms, online CalFresh applications are not returned as a top result-- making it challenging to actually apply. 

Most of the top search results are county websites, which act as canonical sources of information about the CalFresh program. Yet, as of May 2015, 84.5% of California's county websites provide incorrect or no information about income criteria for eligibility in food stamps. This guide will help you get your site on track to help prospective CalFresh clients get the right information to deicde if they are eligible to apply. 

##Steps: 

###Provide the Correct Information
It's important to respect people's time and adopt a "no wrong door" approach to providing information. Provide the information they are looking for on your page- don't redirect them to another page and make them continue seeking out answers. Make sure your information is regularly updated so that it is correct. Key information includes:

####Income eligibility requirements
Let people know right away if they are eligible to apply for CalFresh. Effective October 1, 2014- September 30, 2015, the CalFresh income and eligibility limits are: 

* 1 person in household: $1,946 gross monthly income 
* 2 people in household: $2,622 gross monthly income 
* 3 people in household: $3,300 gross monthly income 
* 4 people in household: $3,976 gross monthly income 
* 5 people in household: $4,652 gross monthly income 
* 6 people in household: $5,330 gross monthly income 
* 7 people in household: $6,006 gross monthly income
* 8 people in household: $3,341 gross monthly income
* For each additional household member: add $678 to the gross monthly income

####Monthly CalFresh benefits allotment
Once a prospective client has determined that they meet the monthly income limits, they will likely want to know how much money they can expect to receive from CalFresh each month. Effective October 1, 2014- September 30, 2015, the CalFresh maximum monthly CalFresh benefit amounts are: 

* 1 person in household: $194 a month in CalFresh benefits
* 2 people in household: $357 a month in CalFresh benefits
* 3 people in household: $511 a month in CalFresh benefits
* 4 people in household: $649 a month in CalFresh benefits
* 5 people in household: $771 a month in CalFresh benefits
* 6 people in household: $925 a month in CalFresh benefits
* 7 people in household: $1,022 a month in CalFresh benefits
* 8 people in household: $1,169 a month in CalFresh benefits
* For each additional member, add $146 to monthly CalFresh benefits

###Make Your Site Mobile-friendly

###Write for the Web
At its core, city websites must provide information that is accurate and easy to understand. This means avoiding highly technical language or jargon, spelling out and explaining acronyms, and making sure your content is written at an 8th grade reading level. 

In general, writing for the web means: 
* Putting the most important information at the top of the page
* Using short sentences and paragraphs
* Making bullets and numbered lists
* Having lots of paragraph breaks 
* Using subheadings
* Optimizing your content with words your users are searching for
