In our work with local and state governments we have seen several high-profile failures in government technology - projects over budget, late, or broken, or existing technology with serious problems. These failures have drawn attention to the way that our governments buy and deliver the technology they need to govern well. 

This playbook has been produced in the context of our wider work - the people, practices and products needed to deliver [21st century government](/governments/principles/) - to help governments in America improve the way they buy and use technology to deliver digital services that work.
