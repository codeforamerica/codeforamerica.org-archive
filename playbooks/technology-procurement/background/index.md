## Background

Over the last few years in our work with local and state governments we have seen several high-profile failures in government technology - projects over budget and or late, failing to work or services already in use showing problems - have drawn more and more attention to the way that government buys and delivers technology to its residents, staff and citizens. 

This isn’t just a problem with government: every organization is dealing with how they can best use technology, from providing better service to doing more with less and competing with new entrants. 

In 2015, it is normal for government technology projects to be late, over budget or to not work. These failures are happening even though all signs point to stricter and more prescriptive procurement requirements as a reaction to previous failures. In general, the process through which governments normally acquire and deliver technology is complex and involved. 

Most government technology is also bought. It’s rare for central governments and agencies and even more rare for local government to have their own capability for developing, delivering and supporting technology. Technology is frequently seen as a commodity or product that can be bought from an external vendor: many technology RFPs talk about needing a “solution”, and vendors are only too happy to describe their products as “solutions”.

The problem is that the promise of technology and its capability to deliver significant improvements has massively changed over the last twenty years. This has been most obvious in consumer technology, where companies like Google, Facebook and Apple have designed, developed and delivered services used by hundreds of millions of people every single day. The internet, web and smartphones are changing the lives of all Americans - not just the middle class - and successful products and services are building new, higher expectations of how the world should work. 

Government, though, has been left behind by this revolution. 

Digital technology has made the gap between policy and successful delivery impossible to ignore. When well-designed digital services implement policy, they genuinely create services and government interactions that are “so good that people prefer to use them.” 

In the U.S., users are surprised when government services work as quickly as commercial services:

## How governments buy technology

This background guide concentrates on how governments deliver digital services. These services range from the outwardly simple (for example, a maternity leave or minimum wage calculator) - to the complex (like benefit eligibility, tax filing, healthcare, education, immigration services and other social services). All of these services are important and critical. They are also not just social program services: starting businesses, paying employees and buying property are all things that citizens and residents need to do that involve the government, all around the world. 

Some of these services are also called the safety net because they are frequently services of the last resort, which means that the government is the only provider. For many people, there are no alternatives to enrolling for social welfare programs. 

### Government services are special 


#### They're uniquely big

The services government delivers are frequently seen by government as being unique in size. Because of their history, the infrastructure used to support these services is appropriate to the time in which they were built. In the 1990s, there weren’t many ways to deliver IT systems for hundreds or thousands of users, nor to handle millions of records. Their size did make them special at the time. Many government services that were designed in the early 1990s had to support hundreds of users at once. The ones that are still in use are now being asked to support thousands or tens of thousands of users. The computers that these services run on -- expensive mainframe systems that made sense and sometimes were the only choice in the late 1980s and early 1990s -- aren't needed now. 

In the 1990s, governments were probably the most common users of such large systems and services. In 2015, thanks to Moore’s law, they are not, and systems and services that deal with such large amounts of information and users are not out of the ordinary at all. Technology companies and startups have delivered reliable, responsive hardware and software for many more users than typical government services using less resources and costing less money. Systems that required expensive mainframes in the early 1990s can now be delivered from a $600 smartphone or a $2,000 laptop or from cloud infrastructure that doesn’t even incur a capital cost. 

#### They must be reliable

Government services are services of the last resort that people depend and rely on. Because of this, governments typically (and rightly) require services to be available more-or-less at all times, despite the same requirements not being applied to in-person or telephone service delivery. This makes sense, because the promise of digital is to massively increase the public’s access to the services that government is mandated to provide. 

However, the policy-driven, top-down way that governments require services to be delivered has not allowed government to take advantage of new techniques to deliver dependability and availability that have been demonstrated by the commercial sector.

#### They must be secure and private

Government services have the potential to record a lot of sensitive, confidential or private data about citizens and residents. Such data really does need to be secure. However, the traditional government policy-driven approach to security requirements has not in practice led to [more secure systems](http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/a-breach-of-responsibility/2015/06/16/040a21a4-1422-11e5-89f3-61410da94eb1_story.html). 

The private sector has shown that successful security is a practice, not a requirement. Security and privacy are not features that government can buy. 

#### They’re old

Twenty years is a long time in technology. A history of treating technology as products or solutions to be bought, frozen and maintained has left governments with a large number of legacy systems that are proprietary, closed-source and with limited ability to extract or export data. 

### Government services satisfy policy needs, not user needs

> “We need to continually test the products we build with real people to keep us honest about what is important.”
> [U.S. Digital Service Playbook](https://playbook.cio.gov/#play1)

The procurement model of government digital services generally leads to services that satisfy policy needs, not user needs. In other words, it is easy to specify and deliver services that adhere to the letter of the law, whilst at the same time missing the spirit of the law. 

A good explanation in Mike Bracken’s (the United Kingdom Cabinet Office Executive Director of Digital and head of the Government Digital Service) blog post, [The Strategy is Delivery](http://mikebracken.com/blog/the-strategy-is-delivery-again/):

> “For digital services, we usually start with a detailed policy.... ...We then look to embed that in current process, or put simply, look for a digital version of how services are delivered in different channels. This is why so many of our digital services look like clunky, hard-to-use versions of our paper forms: because the process behind the paper version dictates the digital thinking.”
> [The Strategy is Delivery](http://mikebracken.com/blog/the-strategy-is-delivery-again/) - Mike Bracken

When government starts with designing and buying products, solutions or systems from policy, users are excluded from the start and their needs and outcomes will always be at best secondary to department or agency needs. This approach rarely if ever leads to digital services that work, never mind services that are humane. 

Kentucky’s health insurance exchange, [kynect](https://kynect.ky.gov/) is a good example: it doesn’t make its users create an account before they can see available plans. The kynect team recognized that the goal was to make enrollment easy - and that requiring users to sign in or create an account before being able to see any information about a plan would be a big barrier. 

In Asheville’s [SimpliCity](http://cityofasheville.github.io/simplicity-ui/#/search), developed in-house, a focus on user needs meant that eight different mapping products and services were replaced with just one service that now delights users instead of aggravating them. SimpliCity combines the approach of integrating legacy back-end enterprise services with new cloud-based services as well as a user research-led approach.

### Relying on outsourcing has meant the decline of knowledge in government

Most governments are reliant on vendors and outsourcing to deliver digital services. But increasing reliance on outsourcing in the valid desire to provide value for money has resulted in a systemic lack of experience and understanding at the leadership and implementation level of what delivering a modern user-centered digital service requires. Worse, this reliance on outsourcing has turned IT in government into more of a contract and project management capability focussed on buying products and solutions, leading to a vicious circle. This fundamental lack of understanding and ownership in digital services means results in less effective and efficient services. And when these services inevitably result in poor user experiences, they leave citizens with less trust in government. 


### Surprises are politically undesirable

Bad surprises - late, broken or expensive projects - are bad news to anyone working in government, no matter how removed they may be from public politics. Wanting to avoid bad surprises - which is completely reasonable and understandable - is normally dealt with by becoming more detailed and prescriptive. In the end, this rational desire to reduce the risk of bad news is part of why RFPs now tend to hundreds of pages of detailed requirements, contributing to the problem without reducing risk at all. 

It seems like it would make sense that specifying all the requirements of a particular piece of technology at the beginning of a project would reduce risk: in theory, government and the vendor would all know what they were required to deliver. The reality is that it is very difficult - if not impossible - to gather all the requirements of a new piece of technology before it is used. Once requirements are documented in an RFP, though, they become much harder (and expensive) to change, even when changes may be obvious to all those involved. In other words, [no plan survives contact with the enemy](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Helmuth_von_Moltke_the_Elder), and requirements can and will change as soon as software starts to be used.
