		<h3>Project description</h3>
			<p>The Portland Development Commission (PDC) submitted a proposal to create an Early Adopter program “to more efficiently use the talents and services of [Portland’s] local tech industry to meet city bureau needs for operations, maintenance and capital projects.” Specifically, the grant is funding:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>An online platform to:
					<ul>
						<li>Enable agencies to post problems and businesses to respond.</li>	
						<li>Allow businesses to propose solutions to challenges they see and the appropriate agency to respond.</li>
						<li>Facilitate a conversation between City agency staff and small businesses around challenges and potential solutions.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>In-person match-making events</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This process will not impact the procurement process; rather, it is an intermediate step that will be taken prior to the process. It does add an additional process, but it is lightweight and should lead to better solutions for government while allowing businesses to test proof of concept solutions.</p>
		<h3>Problem statement</h3>
			<p>The typical government budget process makes it difficult for city departments to invest in proof of concept projects, even if those projects might lead to increased revenue, cost savings, efficiency gains, and improved services.</p>
		<h3>Participating Cities</h3>
			<p>Portland, Oregon.</p>
	    	<h3>When</h3>
			<p>The Innovation Fund began to receive proposals in October of 2013. The deadline for submissions was November 2013. The PDC’s Early Adopter proposal was accepted in March 2014 and the Commission launched the program officially that month.</p>
	    	<h3>Key Team Members</h3>
			<p>As part of its proposal, the PDC created an advisory board to support its specific work. This Advisory Board is comprised of seven board members, in addition to the two staff members assigned.</p>
			<p>The Advisory Board is a voluntary role. The Board is comprised of (1) representative from the Mayor’s Office, (2) staff members from the PDC, (5) agency representatives, and (2) private sector members.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Mayor’s Office</li>
				<li>Portland Development Commission</li>
				<li>Bureau of Transportation</li>
				<li>Bureau of Environmental Services</li>
				<li>Bureau of Planning & Sustainability</li>
				<li>Bureau of Technology</li>
				<li>Office of Management & Finance / Office for Community Technology</li>
				<li>2 private sector representatives</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Two PDC staff members are assigned to the project: Amy Nagy (project lead) and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/jared-wiener/6/936/155">Jared Weiner</a>.</p>
			<p>All participating agencies signed letters of commitment to participate; for example, each agency committed to have a high-level staff member attend meetings. PDC selected these departments based on four factors: (i) a department’s relevant expertise both in policy and practice (i.e. technology); (ii) department budget (i.e. ability to provide capital where applicable); (iii) the department’s openness to new approaches (i.e. are they seeking new approaches to leverage technology); and, (iv) the department’s connections at the intersection of industry and government (i.e. can they serve as a bridge with the community and other government stakeholders).</p>
			<p>Two member from the community also participate on the advisory board. One position is filled with a successful entrepreneur that is operating as an entrepreneur in residence role with the City. The second position is to be filled by a successful entrepreneur with experience selling to government, working within government and working with local entrepreneurs.</p>

	    	<h3>Goals</h3>
			<p>The PDC’s “Early Adopter” proposal seeks to “illuminate tech solutions for city bureaus’ operations and maintenance (O&M) and capital project needs, while giving local Portland companies greater access to a potential customer base.” More broadly, the PDC’s proposal seeks to make the process of contracting with the city of Portland (the procurement process) more accessible to smaller companies. This proposal emerged from the PDC’s experience on a previous project to sign a contract with a startup working in the cleantech industry. Following that experience, and conversations with the procurement department, the PDC sought to create a more efficient process via a technical platform to directly connect departments with local small companies to identify specific issues and generate proposed solutions.</p>
			<p>The PDC’s proposal has two near-term objectives and two long-term objectives. The near term solutions include, first, developing a platform by identifying current city innovation activities. This platform is planned as an outward facing online portal that facilitates the exchange of information between city departments and industry.  Second, and related, the PDC wants two companies to go through the platform, such that “[n]ear-term measures of success will be increased exchange between bureaus and industry and the progress of two or more partnerships/projects to test phase.”</p>
			<p>The two long-term objectives build on the near-term objectives. The first, assuming successful competition of two companies through the online portal, will target five companies completing the process by end of 2015. The second long-term goal is to develop more sophisticated and robust processes for the online portal. The current portal is in the proof of concept phase. Accordingly, there is a lot of uncertainty about the most effective processes, methods, metrics, and tools to assess success. The PDC anticipates substantial changes throughout the process and has adopted an iterative approach to the project: evolving as necessary. This is in keeping with the stated goals of the Innovation Fund to target one time costs on proof of concept initiatives.</p>
		<h3>Process</h3>
			<p>The PDC's project was in response to a policy set by the Mayor's office. The Mayor of Portland launched a special fund, now called the Innovation Fund, as a means to support high risk, proof of concept approaches by city departments. The PDC's proposal, however, was well timed with an internal initiative. The previous year, the PDC, under the leadership of a staff member, had engaged in a process to lure a startup in cleantech to sign a contract with the city of Portland and relocate, from across the country, to Portland. The PDC was successful in this effort, but realized during the process that the procurement system was not adequately set up for contracts with smaller companies that (a) require faster decisions on contracts, and (b) were more high risk because of their solutions might be untested, or with unknown consequence.</p>
			<p>In response to this challenge, the PDC began investigating a new approach to the procurement process. In turn, this led to discussions with the procurement department. The procurement department indicated that the existing system was not the area to modify, for legal and philosophical reasons, but that an alternative approach was needed that allowed for a different form of contracting. Importantly, the procurement department supported this alternative approach.</p>
			<p>Not long after, or in parallel to these discussions, the Mayor announced the Innovation Fund. The PDC applied for funding with the purpose of developing a framework that would be able to replicate the success of the agreement with cleantech company, but in a more efficient and scalable manner; an approach that would address both technical and bureaucratic processes to link industry to government agencies. The purpose was to create a platform that would allow both parties to identify problems and potential solutions.</p>
			<p>As part of the PDC's proposal, an Advisory Board was established. The Advisory Board erected a formal structure to create buy in from major departments in the city. For example, in addition to PDC representatives, the Advisory Board is comprised of the Mayor's Office, two members of private industry, and five representatives from other departments in the city. The other departments were all selected because each plays a substantial role in the areas that the PDC is initially targeting, and because each department has the resources to sign contracts. As a result, a company that goes through the process would, in theory, be able to quickly sign an agreement with the relevant agency.</p>
			<p>The PDC's approach to stakeholder building evolved as a result of two lessons. The first lesson was the need for a replicable and scalable model. This stemmed from the PDC's experience in contracting with the cleantech company. The PDC is structured to focus on four industry areas; the lead for the cleantech company successfully helped with the contract process, which involved multiple city agencies and the cleantech company. The process took a year, required one person to be a champion, but was not a scalable process.  The second lesson was the feedback from the procurement department. The procurement department, advised the PDC not to try to update the existing procurement process, but to create an alternative model in line with the PDC's goals. The procurement department acknowledges the challenges inherent in large public agency procurement but there are also many (good) reasons and parties entrenched in components of the existing process. Together, these two lessons served as the basis to propose a new online portal, separate from any existing resources, and to work with specific entities that had sufficient budgets to invest capital.</p>
		<p>The PDC's proposal has a two-year timeline to get the project live and useful. The first year is focused on developing the Advisory Board's process and methods and having two companies go through the entire process. The second year goal is to have five companies complete the process, and build from there.</p>

		<h3>Costs & Savings</h3>
			<p>The PDC’s proposal included a budget of $160,000. Of this total, $80,000 was to come from the Innovation Fund with the additional $80,000 coming from a Federal grant that had already been received. Going forward, the PDC hopes to demonstrate the value of the proposal such that it becomes a recurring item in the budget from the general fund. The final recurring costs will depend on the specific form this effort takes over the next two years.</p>
			<p>To date the project’s costs include staff time including the time required to prepare and submit a proposal. As part of the proposal the PDC sought funding for creating a technical solution. This has been successfully accomplished and a contract to build the platform has been signed. Additionally, there is a meeting facilitator and paid advisor to the Advisory Committee.</p>
			<p>Perhaps most importantly, the PDC’s proposal originated from two successes. First, the PDC successfully recruited a startup to Portland largely because of the accessibility and willingness of government to work alongside the business for a shared interest. This startup sells water turbines that are in large water pipes for use in urban environments. The city of Portland purchased and installed a turbine, under a city street in a water pipe, and now generates revenue off of the energy produced and sold. Second, Portland’s previous mayor ran a one-off effort similar to the PDC’s current initiative. The initial attempt generated substantial interest in the program but was not scalable because of the significant amount of staff time required to administer it.</p>

		<h2 id="outcomes">Results and learnings</h2>
		</div>
			<p>Key results and outcomes of the project are still emerging, as the program is stil early stage. One of the emergent issues that came out of the process or submitting the proposal was the need to create a system that worked in parallel with the existing procurement system to allow for proof of concept testing. The procurement department, however, informed the PDC that the rules around procurement would, necessarily, make it very difficult to insititute concept testing to the degree the PDC sought to build. Accordingly, in addition to the stated objectives of developing a technical platform and to complete two companies through the process, the PDC is seeking to learn more about how to develop a framework for a feeder system to the existing procurement system. One that abides by the legal requirements but allows the city of Portland to engage in dialogue and contracts with small and local companies.</p>
		<h3>Early learnings</h3>
			<p>There are several takeaways from the build up to the proposal and the proposal itself:</p>
			<p>1) PDC's proposal was in response to policies that originated from the Mayor's Office, over two terms, and by two different mayors. This indicates that strong leadership is needed and over a sustained period. For instance, the current Mayor launched the Innovation Fund, which funds the Early Adopter program, with the explicit purpose of encouraging new approaches by government agencies. But the Early Adopter concept was built on a policy launched by a previous Mayor; the precursor policy was slightly different and focused more on encouraging private industry to bid on government contracts.</p>
			<p>2) The procurement office played an important role. Under the efforts of the previous Mayor, the procurement office regulated the process as they would with traditional procurement efforts. The suggestion by the procurement office that an alternative solution be created and that it live with an agency besides them. It was acknowledged that there was a mismatch of goals of the program and the procurement department’s mission.</p>
		<h3>Focus on testing and learning</h3>
			<p>3) The PDC proposal focused on developing a technical tool before scoping out a final framework. As Jared Wiener noted, they have adopted an "iterative approach." This approach was designed to allow the PDC to learn from going through the process with companies first, and developing an administrative framework around the process; as opposed to creating a process first. This indicates that avoiding any new rules might be more effective to begin, and that developing a framework organically might be necessary because every situation is unique and, at least now, there are no models. It will also ensure Portland can solve problems that exist in today’s environment.</p>
			<p>4) Building on the above, the PDC has experience in this effort.  For example, Amy Nagy's experience, and that of other PDC staff, in previous one-off cases of helping companies navigate the city bureaucracy; experience that provided the impetus to expand the initiative into a formal proposal. Equally important, the experience of the PDC indicates a need for an individual to take ownership over any initiative because the processes are not in place yet for the system to function without a champion.</p>
			<p>5) The PDC’s mission to further economic development in the city of Portland aligns with supporting business growth. Part of the value of the Early Adopter program is to support local businesses that are successful in winning contracts in Portland to export their product and that experience to other cities, in order to develop scalable business based in Portland. Because the PDC interacts with other bureaus within the city, it is well positioned to bring other city bureaus to the process, thereby increasingly the ability of companies to sign contracts.</p>
			<p>6) The PDC made sure to create a wide group of stakeholders within the government. And all of the stakeholders were selected based not just on political value, but because they had budgets to support the initiative. Bracketing the politics for a moment, because of the economic objective (developing the local economy), this indicates that participating stakeholders must be able to financially contribute to any framework.</p>

		<h2 id="next">Next Steps</h2>
		</div>
			<p>The PDC’s proposal is funded by a grant. The program began in 2014 and will operate for one year. At the conclusion of the year, the program will be reviewed in two ways. First, the online portal should be complete and operational. This will allow the program to begin operating at scale. Although it will take another year or so before any final conclusions about follow on steps. And second, contracts through the existing manual system will be complete. This will allow for an internal review of the process to determine what, if any changes need to be made; and potential budgetary needs going forward.</p>
