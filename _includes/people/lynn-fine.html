	    <p class="p-note">As International Programs Manager, Lynn manages an international network of civic innovators, documents civic tech lessons learned from around the world and creates resources to support our international partners in positively impacting their own communities. Lynn is a native San Franciscan who brings a wealth of international experience to CfA. After graduating Summa Cum Laude and Phi Beta Kappa from UCLA with a major in International Development, she went on to work in six countries in Latin America and then in India, resolving policy challenges and managing youth leadership projects. She received a Master in Public Policy from the Harvard Kennedy School, where she was selected as a Harvard Leadership Institute Fellow. In her degree program she focused on learning strategies to improve governance in developing countries with an emphasis on leveraging technology for social impact. Most recently, before joining CfA, Lynn advised the city of Porto Alegre, Brazil on implementing its open data program. She believes that by working to improve governance we can make the delivery of services more effective and positively impact peopleâ€™s lives. Lynn is an avid mate tea drinker and nature enthusiast. When she's not in the office or traversing the globe you can find her in Pt. Reyes exploring the West Marin coastline.</p>
