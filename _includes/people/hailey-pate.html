	    <p class="p-note">Hailey began her public sector career in 2004 when she went to work for the surgery department of a local county hospital. Despite her passion for working with patients, a close call one evening with a sticky freezer door in the hospital basement encouraged her to seek more administrative pursuits. She developed the county’s first injured patient database in 2008 and went on to coordinate EMS and trauma data systems for the State of California in 2011. A Chicano Studies major in college, Hailey isn’t much of a coder, but she still manages to plant seeds of innovation inside government and hack with Code for Sacramento on most Wednesday nights.</p>
