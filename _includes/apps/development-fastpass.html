        <p>Development FastPass helps business owners research the best options to locate their businesses within Las Vegas. The app combines parcel data, land use, zoning, building occupancy, and business incentives to offer recommendations and information on specific properties.</p>
        <p>Built by 2013 Las Vegas fellows Lou Huang and Ryan Closner, the app utilizes the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) as one of its data points. Originally used by the Census Bureau to assess the state of North America’s economy, NAICS is a six-digit classification with each digit corresponding to a specific economic sector, industry group or nation (in this case US, Canada and Mexico).</p>
        <p>Fellows Lou Huang and Ryan Closner quickly realized that this same well-established system could provide a link between the city's own business categories and zoning departments which are governed by two separate municipal codes. What’s more, NAICS could help offer recommendations on commercial land use options by coupling it with additional public datasets.</p>
        <p>The fellows built the Development FastPass application over the course of a few months. If the duo can convince a third party vendor like Trulia to contribute information, there’s also a chance that FastPass will do more than just reveal a property. It will help facilitate its lease or purchase.</p>
