        <p>Neighbors, city staff, non-profits and local businesses all have a vested interest in seeing vacant properties in their community returned to productive use, but a lack of public access to critical information about these properties makes it difficult for these groups to work together to create make informed decisions about the future of these properties.</p>
        <p>In 2012, the City of New Orleans had more than 35,000 vacant properties. When asked to create a public record system to track these properties, government officials assumed it would take several years and millions of dollars.</p>
        <p>In just six months, Code for America&nbsp;2012 fellows&nbsp;Amir Reavis-Bey, Eddie Tejeda, Alex Pandel and Serena Wales joined city officials Allen Square and Denice Ross (among many others) and built&nbsp;BlightStatus (now known as Civic Insight).</p>
        <p>Civic Insight is an easy-to-use, public website that connects directly to internal government data systems to make information about the status of vacant or underutilized spaces available to the public in real-time.</p>
        <p>With Civic Insight, residents and local orgs can search for a property on a map and learn about its ownership, inspection, and permitting history, and subscribe to receive real-time notifications about its progress.</p>
        <p>The app has been so successful that it was chosen as a Code for America&nbsp;Incubator company&nbsp;and has since spun out into a full-fledged startup company called&nbsp;Civic Insight.</p>
        <p>To purchase the application for your municipality, visit civicinsight.com or view the original BlightStatus code at github.com/codeforamerica/blightstatus.</p>
