<section class="layout-semibreve">
  <p>We're excited to be accepting proposals for sessions from our community and expanding our circle. We're seeking diverse representation in our speakers -- in terms of race, gender, geography, organizational affiliation, and topic. We want to both learn about work happening around the world that we may not yet be aware of yet, and spotlight it at the Summit.</p>

<p>We'll be accepting submissions until June 1, 2015, and reviewing submissions on a rolling basis.</p>

<h5>Tips:</h5>

<ul>
  
<li>We like Lightning Talks that have a focus on storytelling. Show, don't tell. What's your story? What are the bigger ideas or lessons that it demonstrates?</li>
<li>We like Breakout Sessions that have a focus on doing and learning. Tell us what your goals are for the session. When participants leave the session, what will they have accomplished?</li>
</ul>
