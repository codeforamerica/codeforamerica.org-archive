        <h3 class="venue-title">Intercontinental San Francisco</h3>
        <p>Stay at the official conference hotel &mdash; the location for our morning breakouts and just a block away from YBCA where the main stage content will take place. Free wireless in the guest rooms, a fitness center and pool, plus a Michelin star restaurant are a few of the amenities you can enjoy.</p>
        <p>A graceful tower of translucent cool-blue soars 32 stories above the vibrant South of Market (SoMa) neighborhood &mdash; and steps from the YBCA and countless restaurants and bars.</p>

        <p><strong>**PLEASE NOTE!</strong> A few additional rooms have become available at the Intercontinental at the rate of $349 (unfortunately, the conference rate of $299 expired last week). Please contact Claudia Barroso (<a href="mailto:claudia@codeforamerica.org">claudia@codeforamerica.org</a>) if you are interested in booking a room. When emailing, please provide your name, arrival date, and departure date. We also recommend checking out <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/" target="_blank">AirBnB</a>.</p>
