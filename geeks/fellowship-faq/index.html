<a name="basics"></a><h3>The Basics</h3>

<h4>Where Would I be Working?</h4>
<p>You'll spend the majority of your time in <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/IqhhH">Code for America HQ in downtown San Francisco</a> with frequent trips to your residency city for needs assessment, research and stakeholder check-ins.</p>

<h4>Will I Receive Wages During the Fellowship?</h4>
<p>In addition to receiving <a href="#appsandtraining">training and mentorship</a>, fellows receive a stipend of $50,000 USD, a professional development budget, travel expenses and health care benefits.</p>

<h4>Can I choose my city partner?</h4>
<p>You will be asked for your top city partner choices once you're selected for the fellowship.</p>
        
<h4>Who are my teammates?</h4>
<p>You'll be paired with teammates based on complimentary skill sets in mid December. 
Our fellows range in their experiences - some have worked at, and even invested, in startups. 
Others are more recently graduated from college, or didn't go to college at all. 
All share a passion for the civic space, talent for making a difference, and the desire to collaborate. 
Last year's average fellow was 30-years-old with previous experience in design, development, research or project management. 
Fellows have come from small startups, design agencies, and larger tech companies like Google, Apple and <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/blog/how-rackspace-supports-code-for-america-fellows/">Rackspace</a> recently started a sabbatical program to support us. You can check out past fellowship bios here: <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/geeks/our-geeks/2014-fellows">2014</a>, <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/geeks/our-geeks/2013-fellows">2013</a>, <a href="https://www.codeforamerica.org/geeks/our-geeks/2012-fellows/">2012</a> and <a href="https://www.codeforamerica.org/geeks/our-geeks/2011-fellows/">2011</a>.</p>

<a name="appsandtraining"></a><h3>Apps & Training</h3>

<h4>Mentorship and Training</h4>
<p>You'll receive training from a variety of leaders in the technology and public administration space on a variety of topics. In past years, fellows have learned to <a href="https://www.codeforamerica.org/2012/10/16/aneesh-chopra-government-as-an-%E2%80%9Cimpatient-convener%E2%80%9D/">navigate the Federal Government</a> from former White House CTO Aneesh Chopra, <a href="http://eaves.ca/2011/01/17/what-im-doing-at-code-for-america/">develop negotiation tactics</a> from public policy entrepreneur David Eaves, and <a href="https://www.codeforamerica.org/2013/12/11/strengthening-the-civic-design-community/">organize for better civic design</a> via Code for America's new Civic Design meetup. In addition to these presentations, fellows are often invited to networking dinners, company visits and special events in the civic tech space.</p>

<h4>What Can I Expect to Build?</h4>
<p>In the past, fellows have built a variety of <a href="../../apps">apps</a> including those that tackle civic engagement, criminal justice, human services, health and environmental issues. Your area of focus will depend on the needs of your host city. But apps are just the beginning. Since this program's inception, fellows have helped release <a href="http://brigade.codeforamerica.org/pages/opendata">1000+ open data sets</a>, facilitate the creation of new local <a href="../../brigade/about">Brigades</a> and encouraged their host cities to institute <a href="http://brigade.codeforamerica.org/pages/openimpact-government">progressive new policies</a>. A complete list of our yearly outcomes is available in our <a href="http://annual.codeforamerica.org">Annual Report</a>.</p>

<h4>Why are the apps open source?</h4>
<p>City apps built during the fellowship are released as <a href="http://opensource.org/docs/osd">open source code</a> and can be redeployed by local volunteer <a href="../../brigade/about">Brigade</a> groups. While it's true that other cities can download and tweak your app code, as a fellow you'll receive attribution and help steer the app's functionality in a way that is customized to meet your host city's unique needs.</p>
