  <h2>About the Program</h2>
  <p>The Code for America fellowship is an 11-month paid, full-time fellowship for experienced technologists. Fellows come from the fields of software development, design, data science, project management, GIS, and often more. They are embedded in local governments in cross-functional teams of three people, and work with their government partners to create a measurable impact on a local problem.</p>

<p>Fellows are based in San Francisco with extensive travel to their assigned city, and receive mentorship from top government and technology leaders. 2016 fellows will be selected by September, join their team in San Francisco in January, spend February in their host city, and divide the rest of their year between the two, with SF as a base. The fellowship ends at the Thanksgiving break.</p>

<p>Code for America actively seeks a diverse fellowship class with multiple perspectives, and invites applications from everyone. Our initial technical skill assessment is blind, to minimize the impact of unconscious bias. We welcome and support technologists from traditionally underrepresented communities. The one restriction: you must be eligible to work in the United States in 2016.

  <h2>What We Look For</h2>
  <p>Strong candidates have a track record of delivery in their chosen field as well as a demonstrated commitment to teamwork and respectful communication. They are curious, friendly, and tenacious when faced with a challenge. They combine pride in their skills and desire to use them for good with genuine admiration for the work of government and the people who do it. Many fellows come to us with previous experience as volunteers civic tech, but many bring other interesting perspectives as well. </p>
