				<p>The Fellowship was transformative. The cities changed us, and we changed them. They now have Innovation Departments, open data policies, and civic hacking volunteers. And we learned how to take our work — our design, coding, and organizing skills — and apply it to something we love: improving our cities.</p>

  <h2>Fix Things that Matter</h2>
  <p><strong>What:</strong> The Code for America fellowship is a full-time paid year of service for experienced technologists. Cross-functional teams of three are embedded in local governments to develop digital tools that help cities and counties deliver key public services across health, economic development, and safety and justice.</p>
  <p><strong>Why:</strong> The Fellowship is your chance to use your skills to directly impact everyday people’s lives. Fellows have improved the permitting processes for small business owners, made it easy for parents to enroll their children in schools, connected families with food assistance, and helped people avoid unnecessary bench warrants.</p> 
  <p><strong>Who:</strong> Fellows come from a range of fields including software development, design, data science, product management, and GIS. Fellows are curious, creative, entrepreneurial, and have a demonstrated commitment to teamwork and respectful communication. We welcome and support technologists from traditionally underrepresented communities. The one restriction: you must be eligible to work in the United States in 2016.</p>
  <p><strong>Where:</strong> Fellows are based in San Francisco with extensive travel to their assigned City, including a month of residency in February 2015.</p> 
  <p><strong>When:</strong> The 2016 Fellowship begins on January 6th in San Francisco and runs through November 18th.</p>
