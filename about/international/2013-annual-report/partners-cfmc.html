            At 21 million people, Mexico City is the biggest city in the western hemisphere and larger than most countries in the world. The challenges of implementing civic technology in this context are immense but global cities like Mexico City are poised to take the lead on issues that nation-states would have tackled in the past. For civic technology to have a lasting impact on the lives of citizens it has to work in places like this.</p>
            <p>Elected in 2012, Mayor Miguel Angel Mancera founded the Laboratorio Para la Ciudad (Mexico City Government Innovation Lab) to institutionalize innovation inside city government. It is run as a creative think tank and is home to <a href="http://labplc.mx/codigocdmx/" title="Code for Mexico City" target="_blank">Codigo DF (Code for Mexico City)</a>. Codigo DF recruited, trained and guided five skilled technologists to serve as fellows for a nine-month program in which they partnered with six Mexico City government departments. Working in partnership with these departments, they used technology to devise solutions to problems facing city residents.</p>

                <p>Mexico City is a thriving metropolis but its residents can feel unconnected to each other and overwhelmed by the multitude of activities in the city because they have no easy way to sort and filter events based on their preferences. Code for Mexico City fellow Carlos Castellanos worked with government partners in the Mexico City Tourism and Culture Secretariats to create a more robust database of the city’s events and activities and then built Eventario to give citizens a better experience discovering them. Doing so required coordinating and opening data across multiple government agencies, which came to form the foundation that powered the Lab’s other fellowship projects.</p>

                <p>Mexico City residents are very dependent on taxis for transportation. There are over 133,000 registered legal taxis and many more illegal ones, but it is very difficult to differentiate between the two. Illegal taxis may look like sanctioned taxis but they do not undergo the same safety evaluation process or pay the same fees as legal taxis. Code for Mexico City fellow Miguel Moran worked with SETRAVI to create Traxi which allows riders to look up a credential number, see whether it is sanctioned, and receive a confidence score and other rider-generated rating information. Traxi is also equipped with a panic button that, when activated, transmits a rider’s location to an emergency contact. By empowering residents with information and tools, Traxi makes transportation in Mexico City safer.</p>

                <p>Mexico City is plagued by high pollution rates, with transport responsible for 60% of carbon emissions. In response, the city has enacted an assortment of policies to cut down on emissions such as limiting the number of days a week that each car can circulate and requiring regular smog checks. The multitude of policies and regulations are confusing and spread out over various departments. Working with the Environment Secretariat, Code for Mexico City fellow Manuel Rabade built Verificalo, a website that aggregates all of these policies and requirements into one place and allows car owners to enter their registration information and get back tailored information about their own obligations (which days they can drive, when their next smog check is required and where they can get one, whether they have any outstanding tickets, and what taxes they owe). It also allows citizens to sign up for text message reminders about all of these things.</p>
                <p>By making this data actionable and putting the citizen at the center of the experience, Verificalo makes it vastly easier for citizens to comply with clean air regulations and helps Mexico City mitigate air pollution.</p>

                <p>Public markets have been a staple of Mexican society for years. They connect consumers directly with producers, foster economic development, support small scale businesses, and create a sense of community. Due to a policy shift that now allows supermarkets to operate within close proximity to public markets, a lack of knowledge of the location and products offered by public markets and outdated legislation that prohibits a range of improvements from being made, public markets in Mexico are losing market share.</p>
                <p>Built by Code for Mexico City fellow Emanuel Zamano in collaboration with the Economic Development Secretariat, Infomercado maps all of Mexico City’s public markets and provides users advanced search options to better connect vendors with customers. It also gives merchants a platform to promote their goods. By bridging the two groups the site benefits merchants and consumers economically and revives the sense of community public markets are known to foster.</p>
