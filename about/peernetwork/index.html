      <blockquote>
        <p>For an organization just beginning our journey into the world of civic technology and open data, the Peer Network has been a highly-valuable resource. Not only is it an excellent platform for exchanging information, it also serves as an ever-evolving dashboard of best practices from across the country. I highly recommend this group to anyone looking for cutting-edge advice on leveraging technology to make their community a better place.</p>
