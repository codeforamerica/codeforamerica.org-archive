                <h2>Why We Code for America</h2>
            </header>
            <p>Code for America believes that a <strong>healthy democracy</strong> is one where government and people work together to improve their community.</p> 
           	<p>This requires <strong>trust</strong> between government and residents. And trust is built when interactions between government and residents are <strong>transparent, inclusive, and respectful</strong>.</p>
												<p>While trust in government is at an all-time low in the United States, <strong>we believe things can be different</strong>. And we believe this starts at the local level — in our neighborhoods, city halls, and community centers — where government most directly touches our everyday lives.</p>
												<p>Through our work with dozens of local governments since 2011, we’ve seen how local governments that practice a <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/governments/capabilities/">new way of working</a> can better serve residents and address the <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/our-work/focus-areas/">important problems</a> facing our communities.</p>
												<p>This is why we believe government can work <strong>for the people, by the people, in the 21st century</strong>. We’re working to make it so, one step at a time. <a hre="#">Join us</a>.</p>
