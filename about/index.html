		<h3>How we do it</h3>
	</section>
	<p>Code for America helps show what's possible and changed tools, platforms, skills, and practices of government in hundreds of cities. Here's a snapshot.</p>
</div>

<div class="layout-semibreve">
	<div class="layout-minim">
		<h4>Showing what’s possible</h4>
		<p>Digital government can cost less and work for the public. Showing what's possible is the first step. Then we spread the word.</p>
		<p><strong>AddressIQ</strong>
		<br /><small>Fellows designed AddressIQ to help the City of Long Beach use data to reduce demands on emergency services.</small></p>
		<p><strong>38 city staff members trained</strong>
		<br /><small>City staff in Long Beach are using AddressIQ to address a huge population of frequent emergency room users</small></p>

		<h4>Changing people and practices</h4>
		<p>Code for America brings technologists into government and supports new practices among existing teams to change how government delivers services.</p>
		<p><strong>Numbers on the board</strong>
		<br /><small>2014 fellow Maksim Pecherskiy became chief data officer for the City of San Diego, one of many technologists moving into government roles to apply their skills to important problems.</small></p>
		<p><strong>55% take civic jobs</strong>
		<br /><small>More than half of 2014 fellows moved on to work in government or civic-focused startups after their fellowship ended.</small></p>

		<h4>Transitioning tools and platforms</h4>
		<p>Consumer technology gets better and cheaper every day. Government technology can too if cities and counties adopt tools and platforms that are built to move with the times.</p>
		<p><strong>Redesigning the experience</strong>
		<br /><small>A city’s website should work for its citizens. User-centered, data-driven, iterative practices help governments build digital front doors to their community.</small></p>
		<p><strong>8 sites overhauled</strong>
		<br /><small>Website redesigns in 8 cities were inspired by Code for America's design principles</small></p>

		<h4>Deepening impact</h4>
		<p>Code for America focuses our work in areas that have positive impact in people's lives.</p>
		<p><strong>Saving the safety net</strong>
		<br /><small>CleanAssist simplifies the food stamp application process, making it easier for eligible Californians to receive the assistance they need to feed their families.</small></p>
		<p><strong>2.5 hours saved each time</strong>
		<br /><small>Users of the CleanAssist program save hours applying for much-needed food assistance through the much-simpler app</small></p>
